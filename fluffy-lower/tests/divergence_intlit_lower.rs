//! Adversarial audit of #37 — the CRUX regression probe: lowering must emit the
//! numeric `value` in the EXECUTABLE expression, NOT the verbatim `raw`.
//!
//! ast.md REQ-6 CRITICAL note: "the fluffy-lower lowering … continues to
//! emit the numeric `value` (e.g. `1000000`), NOT the raw — so the
//! `tests/golden/lower/*.verus.rs` files do NOT change". This test pins that
//! invariant directly on a FRESH `_`-bearing literal.
//!
//! IMPORTANT (critic note on assertion shape): the L1 lowering ALSO embeds the
//! verbatim clause SOURCE text inside the human-legible diagnostic label of
//! `fluffy_check!("req", "x <= 1_000", x <= 1000)` — that `1_000` in the
//! string literal is the original `Clause.text` and is CORRECT (the legible
//! diagnostic, not the executable form). The invariant is about the LOWERED
//! EXPRESSION (`x <= 1000`), so we assert on that form, not a blanket substring.
//!
//! Expected values hand-derived from the cited REQ text — the value `1000` is
//! the `_`-stripped form of the source `1_000` (R-CHAR-3: not copied from the
//! lowerer's output). Expected to PASS under a2c0f73 (documents NO divergence).
