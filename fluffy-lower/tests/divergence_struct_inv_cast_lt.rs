//! Pinned divergence (#148): the #146 cast-`<` paren fix is INCOMPLETE on the
//! struct type-invariant lowering path.
//!
//! Commit 167b9f4 fixed `lower_binary_operand` (the fn-contract / loop-`inv`
//! path, used by `forge tv` + `forge check`'s `requires`/`ensures`/loop
//! `invariant`): a `Cast` left-operand of a `<`-leading op (`<`/`<=`/`<<`) is
//! parenthesized so `x as u32 < 33` does not mis-parse as a generic-argument
//! list (`u32<33, …>` → "expected `,`"). See `divergence_cast_paren.rs` for the
//! #122/#146 family.
//!
//! But the STRUCT type-invariant path (`lower_inv_expr` → `lower_inv_operand`,
//! the REQ-8 `well_formed()` predicate, `.design/lower/...` struct invariants)
//! has its OWN operand-parenthesizer (`lower_inv_operand`) that was NOT given the
//! cast-`<` fix. So a struct invariant carrying a cast left of `<`
//! (`} inv (x as u32) < cap`) emits the BARE `x as u32 < cap` and `forge check`
//! reports L0 with `error: expected ,` — the exact #146 mis-parse, on a path the
//! fix missed. The whole cast-`<` class must be fixed (R-DEFER-8: a convention
//! starts somewhere; the fix is incomplete until every cast-`<` site is covered).
//!
//! Authority: blocker #146 / #148 (the cast-`<` paren discipline — the dual of
//! #122). Expected: the lowering parenthesizes the cast (`(x as u32) < cap`), the
//! SAME form `lower_binary_operand` now emits and `fluffy_tv::ref_encode`
//! always emits. R-CHAR-3: the paren'd form is the design's parse-correct form,
//! not copied from the lowerer's output (the lowerer currently emits the WRONG
//! unparenthesized form).
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d (blocker #148 tracks the fix; un-ignore when `lower_inv_operand`
//! gets the cast-`<` paren — R-DEFER-3).

/// A struct type-invariant with a cast left of `<` must lower with the cast
/// parenthesized (`(x as u32) < cap`), never the mis-parsing bare form
/// `x as u32 < cap` (which Verus/Rust reads as `u32<cap, …>` — "expected `,`").
/// This is the #146 cast-`<` fix on the struct type-invariant path it missed.
