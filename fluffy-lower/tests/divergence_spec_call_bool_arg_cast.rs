//! Divergence pin (re-audit of caa38848/#231, the #225 cast-chain) — a
//! BOOL-typed `Binary`/`Unary` argument to a user `spec fn` whose declared
//! param is `bool` gets a bogus `as u64` narrowing cast, killing the item at
//! L0 (E0308 `expected bool, found u64` — verus-confirmed live on the emitted
//! unit).
//!
//! MECHANISM: `Ctx::spec_call_param_cast` documents `PrimType::Bool => None`
//! as "a no-cast pass-through", but `None` is ALSO the not-in-map/out-of-range
//! fallback — and every consumer site (the `lower_expr` Call-arm arithmetic
//! branch and the `lower_inv_expr` Call arm) collapses both meanings with
//! `.unwrap_or("u64")` and CASTS. The #225 chain comment claims "the bug site
//! never produces a bool-targeted arithmetic arg" — FALSE: the surface unary
//! set is exactly `!` (`UnaryOp::Not`, REQ-10 #92), so EVERY `Expr::Unary`
//! argument is bool-typed, and a comparison `x < y` is a bool-typed
//! `Expr::Binary`. `req s_b(x, x < y)` emits `s_b(x, (x < y) as u64)` → E0308.
//!
//! THE AUTHORITY (R-CHAR-3): `.design/lower/verus-lowering.md` REQ-5 — the
//! narrowing exists because Verus spec INTEGER arithmetic is the unbounded
//! `int` ("the surface integer set is `u32`/`u64`/`usize`"); a bool-typed
//! expression is NOT integer arithmetic, already has the callee's declared
//! `bool` param type, and per fluffy-design.md §4.4 ("All conversions
//! explicit") must flow through UNCAST. Expected substrings are HAND-DERIVED
//! from the fixtures' `spec fn` signatures, never copied from lowerer output.
//!
//! Tracking: crosslink #233.
