//! Divergence pins (crosslink #229) — the #225/#227 type-directed spec-call
//! narrowing cast (`Ctx::spec_call_param_cast` fed by `spec_fn_param_type_map`)
//! is STILL not threaded to every spec-context lowering site. #227 (commit
//! `1c59e4fd`) claims "narrowing target = callee's declared param type at ALL
//! six spec-context entry points", but the PROOF-AID emission paths re-lower
//! contract clauses with a bare un-threaded `Ctx::spec_seq()`:
//!
//!   1. `nonlinear_overflow_assert` (the §sum overflow discharge,
//!      verus-lowering.md REQ-7) re-lowers the fn's `req` clause as a
//!      `by(nonlinear_arith) requires` hypothesis via `Ctx::spec_seq()` with NO
//!      `.with_spec_fn_param_types(..)` — a `u32`-param spec fn named in the
//!      `req` with an arithmetic arg emits the hardcoded `as u64` fallback in
//!      the emitted assert (`s_dec((k + 0) as u64)`), ill-typed Verus
//!      (`expected u32, found u64`, E0308) → the whole item dies at L0 though
//!      the Fluffy source is correct AND the same `req` lowers correctly
//!      (`as u32`) in the signature `requires` AND the lifted loop invariant
//!      two lines above (LIVE-CONFIRMED via `forge check`: `s_dec` L3,
//!      `sum_b` L0, E0308 on the requires hypothesis). Tracking #229.
//!
//!   2. `lower_inv_expr` (the struct-invariant / `well_formed()` predicate
//!      lowering, verus-lowering.md REQ-8) routes a non-method `Expr::Call`
//!      through its catch-all `lower_expr(expr, Ctx::spec_seq(), ..)` — same
//!      un-threaded `as u64` fallback for a spec-call arithmetic arg in a
//!      struct `inv`, AND the catch-all drops the REQ-8 `self.<field>` rewrite
//!      for the call's args (the emitted `well_formed` body references a bare
//!      `x` — unresolvable). Tracking #229.
//!
//! THE AUTHORITY (R-CHAR-3): `.design/lower/verus-lowering.md` REQ-5 — spec
//! position is unbounded `int`; the narrowing target is the callee's DECLARED
//! param type over the surface integer set `u32`/`u64`/`usize` (the #225 rule,
//! re-affirmed by #227's own commit message) — and REQ-8 (struct-inv field
//! rewrite). Expected substrings are HAND-DERIVED from the fixtures' declared
//! param types (`s_dec(n: u32)` → `as u32`), never copied from the lowerer's
//! output.
//!
//! POST-FIX NOTE (c116360c re-audit): the fixture carries the `xs.len() <=
//! 1_000_000` length bound so the EXACT pinned program is live-L3 end-to-end —
//! `forge check`: `s_dec` L3 (1 obligation), `sum_b` L3 (4 obligations
//! discharged). Without the bound the `ens` overflow obligation `result <=
//! xs.len() * u32::MAX` genuinely fails for an unbounded `xs` (a fixture
//! authoring gap, not a toolchain divergence — the c116360c fixer's
//! escalation (1), critic-confirmed).
