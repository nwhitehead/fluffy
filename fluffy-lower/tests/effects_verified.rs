//! Exhaustive equivalence test anchoring `effects::subsumes` to the
//! Verus-verified subset relation (epic #60, `.design/verified/self-verification.md`
//! mechanism (c), AC-4 / REQ-5).
//!
//! The build probe (OQ-1/OQ-2) showed mechanism (b) (linking the verified crate
//! into the cargo build) is not viable for v1: the installed `vstd`/`builtin`
//! crates inherit `workspace.lints` and a `verus!{}` exec body with an `ensures`
//! clause is verus-driver-only syntax. So we land (c): the verified relation is
//! a proved oracle, and THIS test enumerates the ENTIRE finite input domain
//! (2^9 × 2^9 = 262144 (caller_mask, callee_mask) pairs over the 9-atom `u16`
//! bitset, WIDENED for the #106 `Term` atom) and asserts `effects::subsumes`
//! (over `EffectRow`s decoded from the masks) equals the verus-proved subset
//! relation `fluffy_verified::spec_subsumes_mask` for EVERY pair. Since the
//! domain is finite and fully enumerated with 0 mismatches, this PROVES
//! `effects::subsumes` computes exactly the relation `verus` proved
//! `fluffy_verified::subsumes` implements → `effects::subsumes` is transitively
//! verus-anchored.
//!
//! R-CHAR-3: the expected value is the verus-verified spec relation
//! (`spec_subsumes_mask`, an EXTERNAL truth proved by `verus --no-cheating`),
//! NEVER the checker's own output. `unwrap`/`expect` are fine here — `tests/` is
//! not anti-pattern-gated.
