//! Compile-time effect-row subsumption (`fx`) — the static half of Fluffy's
//! effect system (`fluffy-design.md` §4.1: "Effect rows compose: a caller's
//! row must subsume every callee's row, checked at compile time").
//!
//! A caller's `fx` row MUST subsume every callee's row. `fx pure` permits
//! nothing, so a `pure` function that calls an effectful one is a compile-time
//! rejection. This component is the **compile-time check ONLY**; the runtime
//! syscall sandbox (§4.1 "killed at the syscall boundary") is DEFERRED to issue
//! #21 (`goal.md` EXCLUDED-from-kernel). R-SPEC-5: the v0.1 form is implemented
//! FULLY; the deferred form (sandbox) is not built — `effects.rs` has no codegen
//! path, only a checking path (REQ-6 / AC-6).
//!
//! Governing design: `.design/lower/effect-subsumption.md` (REQ-1..REQ-6).
//!
//! ## The lattice (REQ-1)
//!
//! The effects form a lattice over the powerset of the nine atoms in
//! `fluffy_syntax::ast::Effect` (`Read`/`Write`/`Net`/`Alloc`/`Time`/`Rand`/
//! `Panic`/`Diverge`/`Term`), ordered by subset inclusion. `EffectRow::Pure` ≡ the empty
//! set `{}` is the bottom — it permits nothing and is subsumed by everything. The
//! join of two rows is set union. v0.1 subsumption is **atom-KIND level**
//! (path-insensitive): a `Write(_)` caller subsumes any `Write(_)` callee (OQ-1
//! — path-granular subsumption is a deferred refinement that needs a path lattice
//! the v0.1 kernel does not build).
//!
//! ## REQ status
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-1 (effect lattice) | SHIPPED | `enum EffectKind` (the 9 atoms, incl. the #106 `Term`) + `effects` (the powerset projection of an `EffectRow`); consumer `subsumes`/`missing_atoms`; asserted by `tests/effects.rs::lattice_law` (AC-1). |
//! | REQ-2 (subsumption accept relation) | SHIPPED | `pub fn subsumes` (`effects(callee) ⊆ effects(caller)`, `Pure` subsumes only `Pure`); consumer `check_effects`; asserted by `lattice_law` + `crafted_accepts` (AC-1/AC-3). Epic #60: the bit-level subset test is DELEGATED to the Verus-verified `fluffy_verified::subsumes_masks` (mechanism (c), the 9-atom `u16` bitset widened for #106); `effects::subsumes` is anchored to the `verus` proof by the exhaustive 262144-pair (512×512) equivalence test `tests/effects_verified.rs`. |
//! | REQ-3 (check entry point + call graph) | SHIPPED | `pub fn check_effects` builds a name→`fx` map over `FnItem`s (`SpecFnItem`/combinators noted pure) and walks each body's `Expr` tree per `Call`/`MethodCall`; consumer `tests/effects.rs` + the #4 lowering pipeline surface; asserted by `corpus_accepts` (AC-2) + `crafted_rejects` (AC-4). |
//! | REQ-4 (structured rejection, `LowerError`) | SHIPPED | `LowerError::EffectNotSubsumed { caller, callee, missing, span }` in `lower.rs`; produced by `check_effects`; `missing` = `effects(callee) \ effects(caller)`; asserted by `crafted_rejects` (AC-4). |
//! | REQ-5 (maximal-row / slag boundary) | SHIPPED | boundary recorded — `check_effects` enforces subsumption only; maximal-row triage is forge's vacuity stage (#6), not here. No maximal-row judgement in this file. |
//! | REQ-6 (runtime sandbox deferred to #21) | SHIPPED | boundary recorded — this file emits NO syscall sandbox / NO runtime scaffolding; it returns `Result<(), Vec<LowerError>>` and has no codegen path (AC-6). |
