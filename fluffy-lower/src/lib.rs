//! `fluffy-lower` — lowering Fluffy AST to Verus-annotated Rust source, plus
//! L1 runtime-check compilation.
//!
//! In the v0.1 kernel DAG (REQ-2) this crate depends on `fluffy-syntax` and
//! `fluffy-spec`. The L3 emission stage (`lower`) lands in `lower.rs` (issue
//! #4) per the route table; the L1 runtime-check stage (`l1::lower_l1`) is the
//! sibling `l1.rs` (`.design/lower/l1-runtime-checks.md`); the L2 Kani-harness
//! stage (`l2::lower_l2`) is the sibling `l2.rs` (`.design/lower/l2-kani.md`,
//! issue #9 / v0.2) and REUSES the L1 executable lowering; effect subsumption is
//! a separate dispatch. This crate's OWN error type (`LowerError`) is born in
//! `lower.rs` with its first fallible function `lower` (workspace.md REQ-3) and
//! is shared by `l1::lower_l1` and `l2::lower_l2`.
//!
//! Governing design: `.design/scaffold/workspace.md` (crate topology),
//! `.design/lower/verus-lowering.md` (the L3 emission contract).
//!
//! ## REQ status
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-1 (workspace topology) | SHIPPED | this crate is a `lib` member of the virtual workspace in root `Cargo.toml`. |
//! | REQ-2 (dependency DAG, leaf-first) | SHIPPED | `fluffy-lower/Cargo.toml` declares path deps `fluffy-syntax` + `fluffy-spec`. |
//! | REQ-3 (Result discipline; crate error type born with first fallible fn) | SHIPPED | `LowerError` is declared in `lower.rs` with `lower`; `pub use`d below. |
//! | REQ-6 (scaffold compiles clean) | SHIPPED | no stubs, no `mod` pointing at a missing file; `cargo build --workspace` is green. |
