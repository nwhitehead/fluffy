//! Fluffy's Verus-verified soundness-critical pure core (epic #60, Tier 1).
//!
//! Governing design: `.design/verified/self-verification.md` (REQ-1..REQ-6).
//! Thesis: `fluffy-design.md` §6 (Verus is the L3 prover), §9 (the TCB is
//! slag ∪ boundary ∪ the toolchain itself — this crate SHRINKS that TCB by
//! moving a soundness-critical decision function OUT of unverified Rust).
//!
//! ## What this crate is
//!
//! The FIRST proven increment is effect subsumption (`subsumes`): a wrong answer
//! mints a false `pure` certificate for an effectful function (§4.1 / §9). The
//! decision is ported to a bounded **9-atom `u16` bitset** (Read=0 .. Term=8,
//! the path-insensitive atom-kind projection `EffectKind::of` already computes in
//! `fluffy-lower`), where subsumption is the mask test `(callee & !caller) == 0`
//! and the genuine subset relation `effects(callee) ⊆ effects(caller)` is the
//! explicit 9-way conjunction over the bit positions. The two are proved
//! equivalent by Verus `bit_vector`-mode SMT. (The proved bitset WIDENED from
//! `u8` to `u16` for the 9th atom `Term` — the §4.1 terminal-control effect,
//! issue #106 — and every `bit_vector`/`compute` proof was RE-DERIVED over the
//! widened u16 domain; the widened lattice is still sound. `Term` is a
//! terminal-control grant that is NOT one of the 5 io-sensitive syscalls, so its
//! `io_allow` contribution is 0 — runtime-sandbox.md REQ-7 / OQ-5.)
//!
//! ## The landed mechanism: (c) exhaustive equivalence (NOT (b) delegation)
//!
//! `.design/verified/self-verification.md` chose mechanism (b) (link the verified
//! crate into the cargo build so the proved code IS the running code) IF the
//! `--export`/`--import` linking landed cleanly, ELSE fall back to (c) (a verified
//! reference + an enumerated impl==spec conformance test). The OQ-1/OQ-2 build
//! probe (epic #60) settled this EMPIRICALLY: the installed Verus support crates
//! (`builtin`/`builtin_macros`/`vstd`) cannot be consumed as cargo path-deps —
//! they inherit `workspace.lints` from the Verus workspace root (so `cargo
//! metadata` fails outside it), carry `cfg(verus_keep_ghost)` lint configs cargo
//! rejects, and the macro expansion resolves a renamed `verus_builtin` crate. The
//! `verus!{}` exec body ALSO cannot plain-`rustc`-compile: a function carrying an
//! `ensures` clause is verus-driver-only syntax. So (b) is not viable for v1 and
//! we land (c), exactly as the doc's decision rule prescribes.
//!
//! Under (c):
//! - The full `verus!{}` proof (the `subsumes` exec fn + `spec_subsumes` subset
//!   relation + three lattice-law `proof fn`s) lives in [`verus_core`], gated
//!   behind `#[cfg(verus_keep_ghost)]` — a cfg ONLY the real `verus` driver sets,
//!   so a normal `cargo build` never sees it. `tests/verus_verify.rs` runs
//!   `verus --no-cheating src/lib.rs` and gates on `0 errors` (REQ-6 / AC-6).
//! - The always-cargo-compiled plain Rust ([`subsumes_masks`] / its spec
//!   [`spec_subsumes_mask`]) is BYTE-IDENTICAL to the verus exec body / spec. The
//!   toolchain delegates the mask comparison to [`subsumes_masks`]; the
//!   exhaustive 2^9 × 2^9 = 262144-pair equivalence test
//!   (`tests/equivalence` over in `fluffy-lower`) asserts the running code
//!   equals the proved subset relation for EVERY input — finite + fully
//!   enumerated, so this PROVES `effects::subsumes` computes exactly the relation
//!   Verus proved (transitively verus-anchored).
//!
//! ## What this increment ADDS (REQ-7 + REQ-8, epic #60)
//!
//! This increment ports the next two Tier-1 targets via the SAME mechanism (c):
//! - **REQ-7 — the degrade-ladder ANTI-CHEAT.** [`ladder_action_l3_tag`] /
//!   [`ladder_action_l2_tag`] are the plain-Rust mirrors of the verus-proved
//!   `ladder_action_l3`/`ladder_action_l2` decision: a verdict DISCRIMINANT →ladder
//!   action ([`LadderAction`]). The verus core carries the anti-cheat `ensures`
//!   `l3_is_counterexample(v) ==> (r is HardFail) && !is_degrade(r)` (+ the L2
//!   analog) plus a global `proof fn` quantifying it over the whole verdict domain —
//!   a `Counterexample` NEVER degrades (the R-DEFER-9 property). `forge::degrade`'s
//!   `ladder_action_l3`/`ladder_action_l2` mirror this, and `run_ladder` BRANCHES on
//!   the returned action; the in-module `verus_anchor` equivalence test binds the
//!   production decision to these tags.
//! - **REQ-8 — the seccomp allowlist SOUNDNESS.** [`io_allow`] is the plain-Rust
//!   mirror of the verus-proved `io_allow(fx_mask) -> u32` over the 5 sensitive
//!   user-I/O syscalls (openat/socket/connect/getrandom/clock_gettime, bits 0..5).
//!   The verus core carries `pure_has_no_io` (`io_allow(0) == 0`), `monotone`
//!   (subset on the syscall-mask), and `io_allow_within_io_bits` (deny-by-default).
//!   `forge::sandbox`'s `syscall_allowlist` is anchored to this over all 512 masks
//!   by its in-module `verus_anchor` test (OQ-6: the 5 sensitive syscalls only; the
//!   dense `BASELINE_SYSCALLS` stays `sandbox_conformance`-grounded).
//!
//! ## REQ status
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-1 (self-verification architecture) | SHIPPED | the `verus!{}` body in `verus_core` (verified by `verus`, Fluffy's L3 rung §6); mechanism (c) recorded (b empirically infeasible); verified by `tests/verus_verify.rs` (`verus --no-cheating` → 0 errors). |
//! | REQ-2 (remaining Tier-1 targets + porting pattern) | SHIPPED | epic #60. The FINITE-domain Tier-1 fns are now EXHAUSTED: the boundary gate (REQ-9), the project-level min (REQ-10), and the mutation floor (REQ-11) are ported + anchored via mechanism (c). The remaining soundness-relevant fns (`cache_key` — SHA-256, a cryptographic assumption; `triage`/`generate` — AST-walks over unbounded programs; `is_strictly_stronger` — structural contract comparison) are categorically OUT of the finite-domain fragment (the HONEST Tier-1 coverage boundary, `.design/verified/self-verification.md` "Tier-1 coverage boundary"), not deferred. |
//! | REQ-3 (Tier-2/Tier-3 boundaries) | SHIPPED | this crate has NO I/O and NO `external_body` — the Tier-1 cores (`subsumes`/`ladder_action`/`io_allow`) carry real `ensures`, no Tier-3 floor is reached. AC-5: a grep shows zero `external_body`/`external` in `src/`. |
//! | REQ-4 (honesty — genuine proof) | SHIPPED | `verus --no-cheating` (no `assume`/`admit`/`external_body`); the `ensures result == spec_subsumes(..)` is non-vacuous (negating the body → `7 verified, 1 errors`, `tests/verus_verify.rs::broken_subsumes_fails_verification`). The REQ-7 anti-cheat `ensures` and the REQ-8 `pure_has_no_io`/`monotone` lemmas are each non-vacuous (the equivalence tests catch a broken mirror; a mutated verus spec fails — Grounding A/B). |
//! | REQ-5 (FIRST increment — `subsumes` verified + delegated/matched) | SHIPPED | `verus_core::subsumes` proved; `subsumes_masks` (plain mirror) consumed by `fluffy_lower::effects::subsumes`; the lattice laws (reflexive / Pure-subsumes-only-Pure / top-subsumes-all) are three `proof fn`s; the 14 `effects` tests still pass (behavior preserved). |
//! | REQ-6 (CI-able verus-verify gauntlet step) | SHIPPED | `tests/verus_verify.rs` runs the real `verus --no-cheating src/lib.rs` (skip-loud if verus absent, like `lower_conformance`) and asserts `verified, 0 errors`; a core fn that fails to verify is a HARD test failure (R-DEFER-6). |
//! | REQ-7 (degrade anti-cheat verified + anchored) | SHIPPED | `verus_core::ladder_action_l3`/`ladder_action_l2` proved (the anti-cheat `ensures` `l3_is_counterexample(v) ==> (r is HardFail) && !is_degrade(r)` + the L2 analog + the global `anti_cheat_holds_for_all_verdicts` proof); the plain mirrors [`ladder_action_l3_tag`]/[`ladder_action_l2_tag`] are consumed by `forge::degrade::ladder_action_l3`/`ladder_action_l2` (its in-module `verus_anchor` equivalence test); `run_ladder` BRANCHES on the proved decision. |
//! | REQ-8 (seccomp allowlist soundness verified + anchored) | SHIPPED | `verus_core::io_allow` proved over the 9-atom u16 fx-mask (`pure_has_no_io`, `non_widening_atoms_have_no_io`, `monotone`, `io_allow_within_io_bits`); the plain mirror [`io_allow`] is anchored to `forge::sandbox::syscall_allowlist` over all 512 fx-masks by the `sandbox::verus_anchor` test (the 5 sensitive syscalls only, OQ-6). The #106 `Term` atom (bit 8) is non-widening (`widen(8)==0`) — a terminal-control `ioctl` grant, NOT io-sensitive (REQ-7/OQ-5). |
//! | REQ-9 (boundary HONESTY gate — Target C) | SHIPPED | `verus_core::should_emit_external_body` proved (`r == has_boundary \|\| has_slag` + the §9 corollary `(!has_boundary && !has_slag) ==> !r` + the global `regular_fn_never_external_body` proof); the plain mirror [`should_emit_external_body`] is consumed by `fluffy_lower::lower::lower_fn`'s gate, anchored by the OBSERVABLE-dispatch test `fluffy-lower/tests/boundary_gate_verified.rs` (emitted `#[verifier::external_body]` IFF the proved predicate, over the 4 (boundary,slag) combos). |
//! | REQ-10 (project LEVEL AGGREGATION — Target D) | SHIPPED | `verus_core::aggregate_level` (the `Seq<Level>` fold-min seeded at L3) proved with `aggregate_le_all` (D1: ≤ every fn) + `aggregate_is_attained` (D2: == the min); the plain mirror [`aggregate_level`] (+ [`Level`]/[`min2`]/[`rank`]) anchors `forge::manifest::AssuranceManifest::aggregate` over all 341 `Level` lists (len 0..=4) by `manifest::tests::verus_anchor`. |
//! | REQ-11 (mutation FLOOR gate — Target E, #48) | SHIPPED | `verus_core::meets_floor_60` (INTEGER cross-multiply `scored > 0 && killed*100 >= scored*60`, `u128` widening, NO float) proved with the #48 `scored == 0 ==> !r` `ensures` + the global `zero_scored_never_passes` proof; the plain mirror [`meets_floor_60`] anchors `forge::mutation::MutationScore::meets_floor` over the `0..=20 × 0..=20` f64↔integer grid by `mutation::tests::verus_anchor` (OQ-E: 0 divergences — the cross-multiply is the exact rational test). |
