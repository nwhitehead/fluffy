//! `fluffy-syntax` — the Fluffy surface-syntax foundation: lexer, recovering
//! parser, AST, and stable semantic addressing (`loop#1.inv#2`).
//!
//! This is the leaf crate of the v0.1 kernel DAG (workspace REQ-2): it has no
//! intra-workspace dependencies. The four modules below are the executable form
//! of the surface grammar (`.design/syntax/`):
//!
//! - [`lexer`] — `.design/syntax/lexer.md`: source `&str` -> `Vec<Token>`.
//! - [`ast`] — `.design/syntax/ast.md`: the boundary AST consumed by
//!   fluffy-lower (#4) and forge (#5/#6).
//! - [`parser`] — `.design/syntax/parser.md`: recursive descent with per-item
//!   recovery and mandatory-clause enforcement; owns [`SyntaxError`].
//! - [`address`] — `.design/syntax/semantic-addressing.md`: stable positional
//!   block addresses.
//!
//! Per the scaffold contract (`.design/scaffold/workspace.md` REQ-3), the
//! crate's own error type [`SyntaxError`] lands here with this, the first
//! fallible code in the toolchain. No shared `FluffyError` is created.
//!
//! The public surface ([`parse`], the AST node types, [`addresses_of`],
//! [`resolve`]) is the boundary API fluffy-lower/forge consume; it is
//! exercised by `tests/conformance.rs` against the read-only oracle fixtures
//! under `conformance/` (R-CHAR-3).
//!
//! ## REQ status (scaffold REQs this crate root materializes)
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-1 (workspace topology) | SHIPPED | this crate is a `lib` member of the virtual workspace in root `Cargo.toml`. |
//! | REQ-2 (dependency DAG, leaf-first) | SHIPPED | `fluffy-syntax/Cargo.toml` declares zero intra-workspace path deps (the leaf). |
//! | REQ-3 (Result discipline; per-crate error type) | SHIPPED | `parser::SyntaxError` is the crate's own error enum; re-exported below. No `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` in `src`. |
//! | REQ-6 (compiles clean) | SHIPPED | no stubs, every `mod` resolves; `cargo build -p fluffy-syntax` green. |
//!
//! The lexer/parser/AST/addressing component REQs (`.design/syntax/*.md`) carry
//! their own `## REQ status` tables in each module's `//!` doc-comment.
