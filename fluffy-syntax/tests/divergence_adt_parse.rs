/// A `match` ARM BODY is in VALUE position, so a struct-literal construction

/// position (e.g. a `let` initializer, which `tests/adt_parse.rs`
/// `bank_account_parses_struct_with_inv_and_struct_lit` confirms parses).
///
/// The parser threads a `no_struct_literal` context (`parser::Parser`) through
/// the `match`/`if`/`while` HEAD so `match s { … }` reads `{` as the arm block
/// rather than `s { … }` as a struct literal. A contract clause is also a
/// no-struct-literal head (`parse_clause` -> `with_no_struct_literal`). But
/// `parse_match` does NOT re-enable struct literals for its arm bodies
/// (only `parse_call_args`/`parse_index_arg`/the paren primary do, via
/// `with_struct_literal`). So when a `match` is the BARE expression of a
/// contract clause — exactly the shape of `binary_search.th`'s
/// `ens match result { … }` — the suppression set by `parse_clause` LEAKS into
/// the arm bodies, and a struct-literal arm body fails to parse.
