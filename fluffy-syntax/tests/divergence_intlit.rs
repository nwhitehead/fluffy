//! Adversarial audit of #37 — Expr-level verbatim int-literal preservation
//! (lexer + AST round-trip half; the lowering "emits value, not raw" probe
//! lives in `fluffy-lower/tests/divergence_intlit_lower.rs` since
//! fluffy-syntax is a leaf crate and cannot depend on fluffy-lower).
//!
//! The invariant under audit (commit a2c0f73): reshaping `TokKind::Int` /
//! `Expr::IntLit` to struct variants `{ value: u128, raw: String }` is PURELY
//! ADDITIVE — `value` is the `_`-stripped number (the original, UNCHANGED
//! semantics) and `raw` is the verbatim source slice.
//!
//! These tests pin the authority's expected round-trip
//! (`.design/syntax/lexer.md` REQ-3 / AC-2b, `.design/syntax/ast.md` REQ-6 /
//! AC-1b). Expected values are hand-derived from the cited REQ/AC text and the
//! design constant `1_000_000` (Appendix A), NEVER copied from the toolchain's
//! own output (goal.md R-CHAR-3).
//!
//! NOTE FROM THE CRITIC: every assertion below is expected to PASS under
//! a2c0f73 — they document that NO divergence exists across the edge cases the
//! spec names but the pre-existing `tests/conformance.rs` battery did not cover
//! (`0`, multi-underscore `1_2_3`, multi-`_`-with-trailing). If any FAILS, the
//! additive invariant is broken.
