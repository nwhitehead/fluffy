//! The INDEPENDENT operational-semantics reference STATE-DENOTATION for the FROZEN
//! straight-line exec-statement subset (`.design/verified/exec-stmt-tv.md` REQ-2;
//! epic crosslink #158, blocker #159; `fluffy-design.md` §4.1/§6).
//!
//! [`body_ref_state`] maps a STRAIGHT-LINE [`Block`] (the frozen 2.2.1 subset:
//! `let`/mutable-`let`/assignment/`if`-as-statement/sequencing/tail/tail-`return`,
//! NO loops) to a Verus EXEC expression STRING giving the body's FINAL STATE as a
//! closed-form function of the INITIAL state (the fn params). It is the STATE
//! analogue of step 2.1's [`crate::exec_encode::exec_ref_value`] (which gives a
//! single VALUE): where 2.1 checks the per-RHS expression VALUE, 2.2.1 adds the
//! orthogonal axis — the STATE SEQUENCING and mutation-ORDER faithfulness ON TOP of
//! the per-RHS value faithfulness.
//!
//! ## THE STATE-TRANSFORMER SEMANTICS (the new, load-bearing part)
//!
//! The program state is the environment of in-scope bindings (name -> its current
//! closed-form VALUE EXPRESSION in the inputs). Big-step evaluation threads an
//! initial environment (the params, each bound to itself) through the statement
//! sequence to a FINAL environment; the body's value is the tail expression
//! evaluated in that final environment. Concretely:
//!
//! - `let [mut] n = <rhs>` BINDS `n` to the rhs SUBSTITUTED under the current env
//!   (each in-env var replaced by its current value expr). `{ let a = x + 1; let b
//!   = a * 2; b }` -> `a |-> (x + 1)`, then `b |-> ((x + 1) * 2)`, tail `b` ->
//!   `((x + 1) * 2)`.
//! - `n = <rhs>` (assignment / mutation) REBINDS the in-scope cell `n` to the rhs
//!   substituted under the CURRENT env — ORDER-SENSITIVE: `s = s + 1; s = s * 2`
//!   threads `s |-> x` -> `s |-> (x + 1)` -> `s |-> ((x + 1) * 2)`, but the REORDER
//!   `s = s * 2; s = s + 1` threads to `((x * 2) + 1)` — a DIFFERENT closed form
//!   (the STATE-SEQUENCING teeth — `exec-stmt-tv.md` AC-3).
//! - `if c { .. } else { .. }` as the body TAIL composes the two branch
//!   state-transformers into a Verus `if`-EXPRESSION over the (substituted)
//!   condition — `if c { <then-tail> } else { <else-tail> }` (`exec-stmt-tv.md`
//!   AC-4).
//! - the body's final VALUE is the tail expr (or a tail `return <e>`) evaluated in
//!   the final env. A MULTI-CELL final state is a TUPLE `(<cell0>, <cell1>, ...)` —
//!   the tail `(a, b)` projects the final `a`/`b` cells (the design's
//!   least-confident #1, GROUNDED by B4).
//!
//! The substitution + threading + branch-composition + tuple projection are the
//! ONLY new logic; every RHS / condition / branch-tail VALUE is encoded by REUSING
//! [`crate::exec_encode::exec_ref_value`] on the env-substituted [`Expr`] (the
//! per-RHS bounded-value reference is ALREADY independent — it carries the #122
//! inner-paren / #146 cast-`<` / bounded-overflow disciplines). So a value-infidel
//! RHS (the #122/#146/wrong-op class) is ALSO caught by the SAME body obligation
//! (`exec-stmt-tv.md` AC-5).
//!
//! ## THE INDEPENDENCE BOUNDARY (REQ-2 HARD CONSTRAINT, R-CHAR-3 / AC-6)
//!
//! This module MUST NOT call any `fluffy_lower::lower::*` symbol — `fluffy-tv`
//! does NOT depend on `fluffy-lower` (`Cargo.toml`; the dep graph makes reuse a
//! compile error). The reference state-denotation is authored from the FROZEN-SUBSET
//! big-step imperative semantics (`exec-stmt-tv.md` REQ-1/REQ-2), NOT from
//! `lower_block_inner`/`lower_stmt`. Agreement of production's `lower_exec_body` with
//! this reference is N-version differential EVIDENCE, not proof.
//!
//! ## HONEST BOUNDARY (out of the frozen 2.2.1 subset -> an `Err`, never silent-wrong)
//!
//! A construct OUTSIDE the straight-line subset is an honest
//! [`crate::exec_encode::RefEncodeError::Unsupported`] (R-CODE-2 / R-APG-1 — NEVER a
//! panic, NEVER a silent wrong denotation): a `Stmt::Loop`/`Break`/`Continue` (step
//! 2.2.2, kernel-gated), a mid-body early `return` nested in an `if` branch (the
//! multi-exit CPS form, OUT of v1), a `match`-as-statement, a non-scalar mutation
//! (`Vec::push` — a v2 sequence theory), and a re-shadow `let x = ..; let x = ..` in
//! the same block (the flat name->value env can't represent it). A silent wrong
//! denotation would defeat the whole point (TV would compare a wrong reference).
//!
//! ## REQ status
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-1 (frozen kernel exec-statement subset v1) | SHIPPED | the IN/OUT subset is PINNED IN CODE here: [`body_ref_state`] ADMITS exactly `Stmt::Let`/`Assign`/`If`/`Expr`/tail-`Return` + `Block` sequencing/tail, and HONESTLY REJECTS (an `Unsupported` `Err`) `Stmt::Loop`/`Break`/`Continue` (2.2.2), a mid-`if`-branch early return, `match`-stmt, non-scalar mutation, and a re-shadow — the design-amendment-gated stable set; non-test consumer `crate::obligation::body_equivalence_obligation`; verified by `fluffy-tv/tests/body_teeth.rs` B1-B4 (faithful VERIFIES, infidel CAUGHT) + the in-module honest-skip tests. |
//! | REQ-2 (operational-semantics reference state-denotation — independent) | SHIPPED | `pub fn body_ref_state` here — the big-step state-transformer (let/assign substitution-threading, mutation-ORDER sensitivity, `if`-branch composition, multi-cell TUPLE projection), composing `crate::exec_encode::exec_ref_value` on each env-substituted RHS / condition / tail; non-test consumer `crate::obligation::body_equivalence_obligation`; verified by `tests/body_teeth.rs` B1-B4 against real verus (B2 the mutation-ORDER teeth, B4 the multi-cell tuple). Deps `fluffy-syntax` + `fluffy-spec` ONLY (`Cargo.toml`, AC-6) — no `fluffy-lower`. |
//!
//! ## LOOP extension — step 2.2.2-i (`.design/verified/loop-tv.md`; epic #169, blocker #163)
//!
//! [`loop_ref_obligations`] extends the straight-line state-transformer to a v1
//! frozen-subset `while` loop (`loop-tv.md` REQ-1/REQ-2): a single `while <cond>`
//! with declared `inv`+`dec`, a straight-line scalar body, the loop the LAST
//! statement before the tail. It produces the THREE per-run reference pieces the
//! obligation emitters in [`crate::obligation`] turn into Z3-checkable Verus units —
//! ENTRY (`inv` holds on the pre-loop entry state), PRESERVATION (one iteration of the
//! body carries `inv ∧ cond` to `inv`, REUSING the SHIPPED [`body_ref_state`] step),
//! and EXIT (the after-loop state is `inv ∧ ¬cond`-constrained). The after-loop state
//! threads as the design's OPAQUE-but-invariant-constrained fresh cells: a loop cannot
//! produce a closed form (it is a fixpoint), so the post-loop cells are havocked +
//! re-constrained to `inv ∧ ¬cond` (the honest analogue of how Verus itself models a
//! loop's after-state). Every OUT-of-v1 loop (`loop`-kind, `break`/`continue`, a
//! mid-body `return`, a nested loop, non-scalar state, a trivially-weak `inv`) is an
//! honest [`RefEncodeError::Unsupported`] (R-HONEST-3 — Skipped, NEVER silently
//! Faithful).
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | loop-REQ-1 (loop surface + v1 frozen loop subset) | SHIPPED | the v1 IN/OUT subset is PINNED IN CODE: [`loop_ref_obligations`] (+ [`recognize_v1_loop`]) ADMITS exactly a single `while <cond>` with non-empty `invs` + `dec` + a straight-line scalar body as the LAST statement before the tail, and HONESTLY REJECTS (an `Unsupported` `Err`) the `loop`-kind, `break`/`continue`, a mid-body `return`, a nested loop, non-scalar state, and a trivially-weak `inv` (`inv true`) — the design-amendment-gated stable set; non-test consumer `crate::obligation::{loop_entry_obligation, loop_preservation_obligation, loop_exit_obligation}`; verified by `fluffy-tv/tests/loop_teeth.rs` L1 (faithful VERIFIES) + L4 (each OUT form Skipped). |
//! | loop-REQ-2 (the three per-run loop obligations) | SHIPPED | `pub fn loop_ref_obligations` here returns [`LoopObligations`] carrying the three reference pieces (`entry_pred` = `inv[cells:=entry]`; `cond` + `inv` for the preservation step's `requires`/`ensures` over the SHIPPED [`body_ref_state`] step; `after_loop` = `inv ∧ ¬cond` over the opaque cells); the per-cond/inv VALUE encoding REUSES [`exec_ref_value`] on the env-substituted [`Expr`] (independence preserved — no `fluffy-lower` dep). The three Verus-unit emitters are `crate::obligation::{loop_entry_obligation, loop_preservation_obligation, loop_exit_obligation}`; verified by `tests/loop_teeth.rs` L1–L4 against real verus (L1 all three VERIFY, L2 broken-preservation CAUGHT, L3 wrong-exit CAUGHT, L4 weak-inv/loop-kind/break/return Skipped). |
