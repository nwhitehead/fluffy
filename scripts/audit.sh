# Fluffy audit — the skeptic re-derives the ENTIRE trust chain on their own
# machine. The shallow "L3" demo proves an existence claim (one program certifies,
# one mutant is refused). The DEEP audit (default) re-derives each LINK of the
# ACTUAL guarantee and prints, honestly, what it could NOT discharge:
#
#   1  THE UNIVERSAL THEOREM, re-checked locally  — `lake build` the Lean spine
#      from source, then `#print axioms` the five load-bearing theorems and PARSE
#      the axiom lists: PASS iff every list ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}
#      (no sorryAx, no custom axiom). This is the ∀-programs faithfulness theorem
#      re-verified by YOUR Lean kernel — trust does NOT include our claim of having
#      proven it. (Requires elan/lake; SKIPs-with-consequence if absent.)
#   2  FULL-CORPUS cross-validation                — `forge tv`/`exec-tv`/`body-tv`
#      over EVERY admitted `.th` in conformance/. PASS iff ZERO Divergent across the
#      corpus (Skipped/Unverifiable counted + printed, not failing).
#   3  THE FALSIFICATION BATTERY (multi-class)     — the live teeth suites that
#      inject production-side infidelities and assert Z3 CATCHES them (fluffy-tv
#      teeth/body_teeth/exec_teeth/loop_teeth), PLUS one visible end-to-end sed
#      mutant (the legible illustration; the battery is the evidence).
#   4  CORRESPONDENCE DRIFT TRIPWIRE               — the pinned encoder/Lean SHAs in
#      .design/verified/rust-lean-correspondence.md vs each file's CURRENT last-touch.
#      MISMATCH => the inspection-tier audit predates the current code => FAIL.
#   5  THIRD-PARTY PROVER RE-CHECK                 — the emitted golden proof
#      re-verifies under Verus/Z3 with `forge` excluded (the legacy (D) check).
#   6  THE VERDICT + THE RESIDUAL-TRUST STATEMENT  — what you are STILL trusting,
#      everything else having been re-derived here just now.
#
# A guarantee-bearing check that SKIPs (its tool is absent) makes the verdict say so.
#
# `make audit`       runs the deep audit (SLOW — minutes: Lean build + corpus TV + teeth).
# `make audit-fast`  runs the legacy A/B/D existence demo (the old shape) on one program.
#
