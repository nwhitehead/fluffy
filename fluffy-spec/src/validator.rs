//! The SpecTherm validator — the boundary API that walks a parsed
//! `fluffy-syntax` program's contract positions and enforces §4.2's "locked
//! cage": a contract may use ONLY registered combinators (right name + arity +
//! arg-kinds), declared `spec fn` calls, and the built-in operators / literals /
//! paths the grammar already sanctions — nothing else.
//!
//! Governing design: `.design/spec/spectherm-combinators.md` (REQ-3/4/5).
//! Verified against the oracle at `tests/golden/combinators/` (accept.json /
//! reject.json), R-CHAR-3.
//!
//! ## REQ status
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-3 (validator accept rule) | SHIPPED | `pub fn validate` collects `spec fn` names then walks `Contract.req`/`ens`, `LoopNode.invs`/`dec`, `SpecFnItem.body`; accepts registered combinators (via `combinators::lookup`), declared spec-fn calls, and grammar built-ins. Every `accept.json` case validates clean (`tests/combinators_conformance.rs`). |
//! | REQ-4 (reject cases, structured `SpecError`) | SHIPPED | `enum SpecError` with `UnknownCombinator`/`WrongArity`/`WrongArgKind`/`ForbiddenCall`/`ExpressionTooDeep`; `validate` returns `Result<(), Vec<SpecError>>`, never panics. Every `reject.json` case yields the expected cause. |
//! | REQ-5 (bounded recursion — no overflow) | SHIPPED | a single `MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH` guard wraps EVERY recursive descent (`walk_expr`, closure bodies, match arms, index args, if/block tails) via `descend`; deep input yields `ExpressionTooDeep`, never an overflow (`validate_never_panics`). |
//! | REQ-6 (flat-closure-fragment rule — no anonymous nested quantifiers) | SHIPPED | `check_arg_kind`'s `Pred` arm sets `Validator::in_combinator_closure` for the whole closure-body descent (kept set through all nested sub-expressions/closures); while set, `walk_call` rejects any callee resolving via `combinators::lookup` with `SpecError::NestedCombinator`, while a declared `spec fn` call stays accepted. Consumer: `validate` → `walk_clause`/`walk_block` reach `walk_call`. Verification: `reject.json` `nested_combinator_in_closure` → `NestedCombinator`; `accept.json` `named_spec_fn_in_closure` → `Ok`; the flat corpus closures stay `Ok` (`tests/combinators_conformance.rs`). |
//!
//! ## Basis Stage 1b — the REAL ADT validator (`.design/basis/01-adts.md`)
//!
//! Stage 1b REPLACES the 1a `UnsupportedAdt` gate with real exhaustiveness +
//! well-formedness checking. The 3 ADT corpus programs validate clean; crafted
//! negatives reject with the precise structured error. Verified against the
//! oracle `conformance/adt-validate/cases.json` (R-CHAR-3) via
//! `tests/adt_validate.rs`. Lowering stays gated (Stage 1c, fluffy-lower).
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-5 (exhaustiveness — `NonExhaustiveMatch`/`UnreachableArm`) | SHIPPED | declaration pre-pass `Validator::new` collects `enums` (name → variant order) + `variant_to_enum`; `check_match_exhaustiveness` (reached from both the caged `walk_expr_inner` `Match` arm AND the exec-body `scan_expr_for_loops` `Match` arm) infers the matched enum from arm patterns (`variant_pattern_name`), then emits `NonExhaustiveMatch { missing }` (declaration order), `UnreachableArm` (variant twice / arm after wildcard), `UnknownVariant` (undeclared variant in a pattern). Slice/`Option` matches are inert (no regression). Consumer: `validate`. Verification: `tests/adt_validate.rs` `non_exhaustive_match` → `missing:[Rect]`; `unreachable_redundant_arm` → `UnreachableArm`; `unknown_variant_pattern` → `UnknownVariant{Square}`; `shape`/`list_sum` accept. |
//! | REQ-6 (well-formed field/variant access + `is`) | SHIPPED | pre-pass collects `struct_fields` (every `struct`/struct-variant field). `check_field` (on `Expr::Field` + `Expr::StructLit` fields, both walks) → `UnknownField` for an undeclared field (inert when no struct declared). `check_variant_ref` (on `Expr::Is`, both walks) → `UnknownVariant` for an undeclared variant. Consumer: `validate`. Verification: `unknown_field` → `UnknownField{bogus}`; `unknown_variant_is` → `UnknownVariant{Triangle}`; `bank_account`/`shape` accept. |
//! | REQ-2 (variant names UpperCamelCase — `InvalidVariantCasing`) | SHIPPED | #66. The declaration pre-pass `Validator::new` rejects any `enum` variant whose first char is not `is_ascii_uppercase()` with `SpecError::InvalidVariantCasing { name, span }`, seeded into the error list BEFORE the body/contract walk. This is load-bearing for soundness: the parser disambiguates a single-segment arm pattern by first-letter case (uppercase → `Pattern::Enum`, lowercase → `Pattern::Binding`), so forbidding lowercase variants makes that split sound — a lowercase pattern ident is unambiguously a binding (no lowercase variant can exist), closing the #66 bypass where a lowercase variant masqueraded as a catch-all and masked a non-exhaustive `match`. Consumer: `validate`. Verification: `tests/divergence_adt_validate.rs` `divergence_lowercase_variant_bypasses_exhaustiveness` → `InvalidVariantCasing{foo}`, `divergence_lowercase_arm_masks_unhandled_variant` → `InvalidVariantCasing{tri}`; `exhaustiveness_intact_uppercase_nonexhaustive` confirms uppercase enums still get `NonExhaustiveMatch`. |
//! | REQ-7 (ADT predicates fit the cage — flat built-ins) | SHIPPED | `Expr::Match`/`Field`/`Is`/`Deref` are FLAT built-ins in `walk_expr_inner` — they recurse operands without setting `in_combinator_closure` and without resolving as combinators, so they are admitted unchanged inside a combinator predicate-closure body (the existing caged-flat walk). No recursive scheme exists yet to nest (forward-declared; schemes are Stage 2). Verification: the combinator cage tests (`tests/combinators_conformance.rs`) stay green. |
//! | 1a GATE (`SpecError::UnsupportedAdt`) | RETIRED for well-formed ADTs | the variant is RETAINED (downstream `forge`/`fluffy-lower` reference it by name in comments and it screams for a future un-checkable ADT form) but has NO live emitter in 1b: `run`'s `Item::Struct` now cages the `inv` clause, `Item::Enum` is a no-op, and `walk_expr_inner`'s `Expr::StructLit`/`Expr::Is`/`Expr::Deref` arms validate-or-accept. A well-formed ADT no longer dies at the gate. |
//!
//! ## Basis Stage 2b — recursion-scheme recognition + the flat-step cage (`.design/basis/02-recursion-schemes.md`)
//!
//! Stage 2b EXTENDS the cage to recognize a recursion-scheme call
//! (`fold`/`map`/`for_all`/`exists`/`traverse`) as a named-composition leaf and
//! to reject a scheme/combinator NESTED in a scheme's step closure (the flat-step
//! cage). Verified against the oracle `conformance/adt-schemes/cases.json`
//! (R-CHAR-3) via `fluffy-spec/tests/scheme_validate.rs`.
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-1 (scheme set recognized as named primitives) | SHIPPED | `walk_call` resolves a callee `Path` against `schemes::lookup` FIRST; a registered scheme call is checked by `check_scheme` (total arity = `SchemeSig::total_arity`) and ACCEPTED at top level. Consumer: `validate` → `walk_call`. Verification: `scheme_validate.rs` `list_fold_validates` (the `fold`/`for_all` calls of `conformance/list_fold.th` validate clean); `unknown_scheme` → `UnknownCombinator` (an unregistered callee like `frobnicate` is neither scheme/combinator/spec-fn). |
//! | REQ-2 (flat step closure — arity + no nested scheme) | SHIPPED | `check_scheme` requires the trailing arg to be an `Expr::Closure` whose param count matches `SchemeSig::step_shape.arity()` (`SchemeStepShape` otherwise) and walks the step body in `in_scheme_step` mode; while set, `walk_call` rejects a registered scheme OR combinator callee with `SpecError::NestedScheme`. Consumer: `validate`. Verification: `scheme_validate.rs` `nested_scheme_in_step` → `NestedScheme` (a `fold` inside a `fold` step). |
//! | REQ-4 (cage bridge — named structural quantification; nested-scheme reject) | SHIPPED | a top-level `for_all`/`fold` scheme call is ACCEPTED as a named-composition leaf (mirroring the combinator-call accept, REQ-6); a scheme nested in a step / a combinator closure is `NestedScheme`. The scheme accept JOINS the combinator-call accept in `walk_call`; the caged-flat walk (`walk_expr_inner`, Stage 1 REQ-7) is unchanged. Verification: `scheme_validate.rs` `list_fold_validates` + `nested_scheme_in_step`. |
//! | REQ-9 (`SpecError` extension, no panics) | SHIPPED | `SpecError::{NestedScheme, SchemeWrongArity, SchemeStepShape}` are span-bearing variants; `validate` returns `Result<(), Vec<SpecError>>`, never panics. The structural-`dec` reject (REQ-5) reuses Stage 1's recursive-`spec fn` `dec` diagnostic (a generated `fold_<e>` is checked exactly as a hand-written recursive `spec fn` — `fluffy-lower`). |
//!
//! ## REQ status — 04-collections.md (Basis Stage 4, issue #73)
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-3 (capacity + operation contracts fit the §4.2 cage) | SHIPPED | the bounded-`Vec` operation contracts are FLAT built-ins: `v.len()` (already in `BUILTIN_METHODS`) and the no-OOB accessor `get` ADDED to `BUILTIN_METHODS` so `ens result == v.get(i)` (`conformance/vec_demo.th` `checked_get`) validates inside the cage; the capacity bound `v.len() < CAP` / `result.len() == v.len() + 1` (`push_one`) are flat comparisons over the `len` built-in. The caged-flat walk (`walk_expr_inner`'s `MethodCall` arm) is UNCHANGED — a Vec `len`/`get` is the same flat built-in as a slice `len`. `push`/`pop` are EXEC-only (never in a contract), so the cage does not admit them. Consumer: `validate` → `walk_expr_inner`. Verification: `fluffy-lower/tests/collections_conformance.rs` (the contracts validate clean + real verus L3). |
//! | REQ-4 (element invariant via named `spec fn`) | NOT-STARTED | epic **#62** Stage 4 (v1.1). The element invariant (`forall_in(v, |e| inv(e))` as a named `spec fn`, preserved across `push`) reuses the existing named-`spec fn` accept path UNCHANGED — but the v1 corpus oracle (`conformance/vec_demo.th`) exercises only the capacity contract + no-OOB get; no `Vec<Account>` element-invariant program is in the corpus, so this REQ is deferred to a Stage-4 follow-up (the GROUNDED `all_elems_inv` form is design-confirmed feasible, not yet corpus-exercised). |
//! | REQ-12 (`last`/`contains` in `BUILTIN_METHODS`) | SHIPPED | #98 cluster C6. `last` and `contains` ADDED to `BUILTIN_METHODS` so an `ens result == v.last()` / `ens result == v.contains(x)` validates inside the §4.2 cage exactly as the no-OOB `get` does (the lowerer maps spec-position `v.last()` to the wrapper's `spec_get((len-1) as int)`; `contains`'s `exists`-meaning is PROVED by the exec `ens`'s linear-scan invariant, R-DEFER-9). `pop_last`/`insert`/`remove` stay EXEC-only (`&mut` mutators, never in a contract). The caged-flat walk (`walk_expr_inner`'s `MethodCall` allowlist arm) is UNCHANGED. Consumer: `pub fn validate` → `walk_expr_inner`. Verification: `forge/tests/vec_completeness_conformance.rs` (the C6 ops certify L3) + `cargo test -p fluffy-spec`. |

The round-trip / absent→None contracts are the C7 spec-`match`-in-`ens` over `get`'s `Option` result (the admitted flat-`match` cage rule, 01-adts REQ-7), UNCHANGED. The caged-flat walk (`walk_expr_inner`'s `MethodCall` allowlist arm) is UNCHANGED. Consumer: `pub fn validate` → `walk_expr_inner`.

//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-8 (`#[sealed]` abstraction barrier — the door is the only mint) | SHIPPED | epic **#62** Stage 6 (#77). The declaration pre-pass `Validator::new` collects `sealed_structs` (every `Item::Struct` with `sealed == true`, alongside `struct_fields`). The new span-bearing `SpecError::SealedConstruction { name, span }` variant is emitted by `check_sealed_construction`, called from BOTH `Expr::StructLit` walk arms (the exec-body `scan_expr_for_loops` AND the caged `walk_expr_inner`): any struct literal whose `path` resolves to a `#[sealed]` struct is REJECTED, so a `#[sealed]` clean/capability type (`Sql`/`Public`/`Authorized`) is obtainable ONLY as a `#[boundary]` door's return (the door body is foreign/`external_body`, no in-language `StructLit`). Inert when no `#[sealed]` struct is declared (the non-IFC corpus is UNCHANGED). Consumer: `pub fn validate` → `forge::check::check_file` (a `ForgeError::Spec`, exit non-zero, no L3 cert). Verification: `fluffy-spec/tests/sealed_validate.rs` (the launder rejects with `SealedConstruction{Sql}`; the safe doored path + a plain/no-sealed struct validate clean); `forge/tests/divergence_provenance.rs` (the 3 #77 bypass tests, UN-IGNORED, REJECT on all three axes); `forge/tests/provenance_conformance.rs` unchanged (safe paths L3, naive careless L0). |

Both are constructing ops (`fx alloc`). Consumer: `pub fn validate` → `walk_expr_inner` (`BUILTIN_METHODS` allowlist). Verification: `forge/tests/string_format_conformance.rs` (the byte-builder certifies L3 / `effects: [alloc]` against real verus, the GROUNDED `4 verified, 0 errors` form). |
//! | REQ-8 (`u64_to_string` — decimal formatting, ROUND-TRIP contract; `fx alloc`) | SHIPPED | #94 cluster C4 (+ blocker #96 MSB-first display). `to_string` ADDED to `BUILTIN_METHODS` (the `n.to_string()` method spelling); the GENERATED round-trip spec fns `parse_be`/`parse_le`/`pow10` are seeded into `spec_fns` (`GENERATED_SPEC_FNS`) so a contract `ens parse_be(result) == n` validates inside the cage as a named `spec fn` call. The lowerer (`fluffy-lower::lower`) emits the `u64_to_string` exec (LSB build + reverse to MSB-first) + `pow10`/`parse_le`/`parse_be`/`seq_reverse` spec + `lemma_parse_push` + the `parse_be(seq_reverse(s)) == parse_le(s)` bridge lemmas.

//! | REQ-13 (`contains`/`starts_with`/`ends_with` — boolean substring predicates; `pure`) | SHIPPED | #102 cluster C5. `starts_with`/`ends_with` ADDED to `BUILTIN_METHODS` (so `ens result == occurs_at(s@, needle@, ..)` validates inside the §4.2 cage); `contains` was already present (C6) and is RECEIVER-TYPE-dispatched by the lowerer (a `String` receiver → `TString::contains` substring scan, a `Vec` receiver → `TVec::contains` membership — Rust inherent-method resolution, no clobber). `GENERATED_SPEC_FNS` += `occurs_at`/`contains_sub` so the cage admits the named predicate.

With them registered, `Some(v)`/`Ok(v)` construction is accepted (the exec-body walk recurses `Call`/`Path`, no `UnknownVariant`), `match` over them is exhaustiveness-checked (`check_match_exhaustiveness` now infers `Option`/`Result` — both arms or a `Wildcard` required), and `r is Some` (`check_variant_ref`) accepts. The spec-`match`-in-`ens` payload projection needs NO new cage rule — `walk_expr_inner`'s `Match` arm already admits a flat `match` as a built-in (01-adts REQ-7), so `match result { Some(v) => <flat pred>, None => true }` in an `ens` is an accepted flat predicate. `GENERATED_SPEC_FNS` += `all_digits`/`is_digit`.

The `fx diverge` exemption is honored by `fn_is_diverge` (mirroring `fluffy-lower`'s — the single §4.1 truth): a diverge fn recurses WITHOUT `dec` and is L1-capped (#88). Mutual recursion (REQ-6) is OUT of v1 — a pair that calls EACH OTHER (no direct self-call) is not flagged here; it reaches Verus and is rejected there (no false L3, no crash).

//! | REQ-3 (match guards — exhaustiveness down-weight) | SHIPPED | `check_match_exhaustiveness` reads `arm.guard.is_some()`: a GUARDED arm is NEVER a catch-all and NEVER marks its variant `covered` (the guard may fail), so a guarded-only `Some` arm leaves `Some` uncovered → `SpecError::NonExhaustiveMatch` (the GROUNDED Verus rule: a guarded-only arm is non-exhaustive). When NO arm names a declared variant (so the enum cannot be inferred from the patterns — e.g. a guarded CATCH-ALL `match m { _ if cond => 0 }`), a match whose EVERY arm is guarded covers nothing unconditionally and is `NonExhaustiveMatch`; an UNGUARDED catch-all (`match m { _ => 0 }`) still completes the match (accepted, #120). A guard `Expr` is also walked by `walk_expr`/`scan_expr_for_loops` (an unknown field/variant in a guard is flagged). Consumer: `pub fn validate`.

So `Some(_) \| None` is EXHAUSTIVE over `Option`-like enums; an `Or` over a strict subset still leaves the rest `NonExhaustiveMatch`. `variant_pattern_name` resolves the matched enum from the first variant-naming alternative.
