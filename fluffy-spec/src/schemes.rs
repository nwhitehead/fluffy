//! The recursion-scheme registry — the frozen, closed set of verified recursion
//! schemes (`.design/basis/02-recursion-schemes.md` REQ-1) over recursive ADTs:
//! `fold`, `map`, `for_all`, `exists`, `traverse`. The structural complement of
//! `combinators.rs`'s `static REGISTRY` + `lookup` (the OQ-1 (a) resolution: a
//! scheme CALL reuses `Expr::Call` with a scheme-name callee `Path`, and the
//! scheme-ness is recognized by THIS registry, not a new `Expr` node).
//!
//! Governing design: `.design/basis/02-recursion-schemes.md` (REQ-1, REQ-2).
//! Pinned against the hand-derived oracle at
//! `conformance/adt-schemes/cases.json` (R-CHAR-3).
//!
//! ## Scope (the 2b vs 2c split, mirroring combinators.rs)
//!
//! This registry ships the STRUCTURAL facet the validator (Stage 2b) needs: the
//! scheme name, the step shape (`|x, acc|` for `fold`/`traverse`, `|x|` for
//! `map`/`for_all`/`exists`), and the result kind. The validator reads it to (i)
//! recognize a scheme call as a named-composition leaf (REQ-4) and (ii) enforce
//! the FLAT step closure (REQ-2 — the right step arity, no nested scheme). The
//! GENERATION facet — the per-(ADT, scheme) Verus recursive `spec fn`
//! (`fold_<e>`/`for_all_<e>`) + the `fold_bound_<e>` law — is materialized by
//! `fluffy-lower` (Stage 2c, the registry's lowering consumer), exactly as the
//! combinator `verus_l3` facet is `fluffy-lower`'s consumer.
//!
//! The generated names are a DETERMINISTIC function of the scheme + the ADT name
//! (`fold_<lowercased-enum-name>`), so the lowerer and any future audit-surface
//! consumer agree on the symbol without a string-name guess (REQ-1; R-CODE-5).
//!
//! ## REQ status
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-1 (the scheme set as named primitives; AST = `Expr::Call` + registry) | SHIPPED | `static REGISTRY: [SchemeSig; 5]` — the 5 frozen schemes (`fold`/`map`/`for_all`/`exists`/`traverse`); `lookup(name)` resolves a callee `Path` to its `SchemeSig`; consumed by `validator::validate` (the scheme-call accept) and `fluffy_lower::lower` (the generated-fn name via `generated_fn_name`). Asserted against `conformance/adt-schemes/cases.json` in `fluffy-spec/tests/scheme_validate.rs`. |
//! | REQ-2 (the step — flat per-node closure; step arity by scheme) | SHIPPED | `SchemeSig.step_arity` (2 for `fold`/`traverse`, 1 for `map`/`for_all`/`exists`) + `SchemeSig.scrutinee_args` (the non-step positional args before the step); `validator` checks the step closure's param count against `step_arity` and the total call arity, and rejects a nested scheme in the step body. |
