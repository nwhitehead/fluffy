//! Divergence pin for Cluster **C10** (crosslink **#112**), audit of commit
//! `d72e60f`. The C10 REQ-3 rule (`.design/basis/11-ergonomics.md`) — restated in
//! the doc's Architecture section — is:
//!
//! > A **guarded** arm covers NONE of its pattern's cases (the guard may be
//! > false) — GROUNDED: Verus rejects a guarded-only `Some` arm as
//! > non-exhaustive.
//!
//! and AC-3b: "a guard does NOT complete a match ... The validator MUST reject
//! it (matching Verus's `error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns`)."
//!
//! DIVERGENCE: `validator::check_match_exhaustiveness` identifies the matched
//! enum ONLY from an arm whose pattern NAMES a declared variant
//! (`variant_pattern_name`). A match whose only arm is a GUARDED catch-all
//! (`_ if cond => …`) over an enum names no variant, so `matched_enum` is `None`
//! and the function returns early WITHOUT any exhaustiveness check — accepting a
//! match that the design's own rule says is non-exhaustive (the guard may fail,
//! so `_ if cond` covers nothing). The corpus test
//! `forge/tests/ergonomics_conformance.rs::req3_guarded_only_arm_is_non_exhaustive`
//! only exercises the case where a SIBLING `No` arm names a variant (so the enum
//! is detected); the all-catch-all case is unpinned.
//!
//! Verus DOES backstop this end-to-end (the lowered match is `error[E0004]`
//! non-exhaustive → forge reports L0), so this is NOT an L3-laundering soundness
//! hole; it is a validator-completeness divergence from the design's literal
//! REQ-3 rule (the toolchain should pre-empt with a structured
//! `NonExhaustiveMatch`, not defer to an opaque verus L0).
//!
//! AUTHORITY: `.design/basis/11-ergonomics.md` REQ-3 / AC-3b ("a guard does NOT
//! complete a match"). The expected outcome (`NonExhaustiveMatch`) is
//! hand-derived from the design rule (R-CHAR-3 — not copied from the toolchain;
//! the toolchain currently returns `Ok(())`, the opposite).
//!
//! Tracking: blocker #120.
