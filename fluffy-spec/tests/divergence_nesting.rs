//! Adversarial audit of REQ-6 (the flat-closure-fragment rule, issue #40) as
//! landed in commit 4d46f8a (`SpecError::NestedCombinator` + the
//! `Validator::in_combinator_closure` caged-flat flag).
//!
//! Authority: `.design/spec/spectherm-combinators.md` REQ-6 + AC-6/7/8;
//! `fluffy-design.md` §4.2 ("No general quantifiers … a fixed library of
//! bounded combinators … Fluffy locks the cage"). R-CHAR-3: every expected
//! value below is the design-doc's REQ-6/AC-6/7/8 outcome (REJECT-with-
//! `NestedCombinator` for an anonymous nested combinator; `Ok` for named
//! composition + non-nested siblings), never copied from validator output.
//!
//! These probe the edges the `accept.json`/`reject.json` oracle does NOT cover
//! directly: deeper / other-clause / 3-arg-outer nestings that must STILL
//! reject (under-enforcement), and non-nested siblings + the named-spec-fn-body
//! composition escape that must STAY accepted (over-enforcement / flag leak).
//!
//! AUDIT RESULT: NO DIVERGENCE. Every assertion below holds against 4d46f8a —
//! these are characterization/regression guards, not failing-divergence pins.
//! (The one cosmetic artifact — a co-emitted misleading `ForbiddenCall` on an
//! already-`NestedCombinator`-rejected program — is documented in
//! `nested_combinator_does_not_change_reject_verdict` below; it is diagnostic
//! noise on a correctly-rejected program, not a REQ-6 divergence: AC-6 pins the
//! reject OUTCOME + the cause being present, both satisfied.)
