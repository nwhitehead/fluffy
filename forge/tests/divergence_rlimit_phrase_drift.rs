//! Divergence pin (crosslink #192, ref #166 #189), now SATISFIED by the root-cause
//! fix: the rlimit/timeout signal discriminator was duplicated across the three forge
//! translation-validation phases (`contract_tv`, `body_tv`, `exec_tv`) and the copies
//! DRIFTED — `contract_tv::is_rlimit_signal` dropped the `"resource limit exceeded"`
//! phrase (so the bundled z3's OWN resourceout literal `max. resource limit exceeded`
//! on an `errors >= 1` run was fabricated into `ClauseVerdict::Divergent`), and
//! `exec_tv::discharge` had NO rlimit gate at all (every `errors >= 1` run → Divergent
//! unconditionally — the same #189 class).
//!
//! THE FIX (the oracle these tests pin): ONE shared discriminator
//! `forge/src/tv_signal.rs::is_rlimit_signal` covering the FULL phrase set
//! (`rlimit exceeded`, `rlimit) exceeded`, `resource limit exceeded` — the last of
//! which ALSO catches z3's `max. resource limit exceeded`), consumed by ALL THREE
//! phases (the per-phase copies deleted). With one shared discriminator the phrase set
//! CANNOT drift again, and the z3-phrased resourceout is caught in every phase.
//!
//! WHY THE Z3 PHRASE IS LOAD-BEARING, not defensive padding: the distributed z3 binary
//! (verus 0.2026.05.24.ecee80a toolchain, `~/.local/share/verus/verus-x86-linux/z3`)
//! contains the literal diagnostic `max. resource limit exceeded` — Z3's OWN
//! resourceout message (its `:reason-unknown` text on an rcounts exhaustion). That
//! string contains `resource limit exceeded` but NEITHER `rlimit exceeded` NOR
//! `rlimit) exceeded` (verus's own phrasing, `Resource limit (rlimit) exceeded`, is a
//! separate `air` literal). An `errors >= 1` run whose combined output surfaces only
//! the Z3-phrased resourceout (e.g. a raw `:reason-unknown` passthrough) must therefore
//! degrade to Unverifiable, never a fabricated Divergent (R-HONEST-3: a non-infidelity
//! outcome is never a false Divergent; R-CODE-4: a timeout degrades, never a false
//! result).
//!
//! AUTHORITY (the expected values come from these, NEVER from the toolchain's own
//! output — R-CHAR-3):
//! - `forge/src/body_tv.rs`'s former `is_rlimit_signal` (the #189 precedent): the
//!   THREE-phrase set the shared discriminator must carry.
//! - The z3 binary literal `max. resource limit exceeded` (observed via `strings` on
//!   the distributed toolchain), independent of any Fluffy source.
//! - `goal.md` R-HONEST-3 / R-CODE-4: a timeout is never a fabricated Divergent.
//!
//! MECHANICS: `is_rlimit_signal` is `pub(crate)` to the `forge` binary crate,
//! unreachable from an integration test, and a real Z3 rlimit exhaustion is not
//! deterministically forcible. So this pin works at the SOURCE seam (the same
//! technique the original #192 pin used, re-aimed at the new SHARED helper per the
//! #192 dispatch's authorization): it extracts the `contains("…")` phrase literals
//! from `tv_signal.rs::is_rlimit_signal` and (a) asserts the shared discriminator's
//! phrase set covers body_tv's #189 three-phrase authority (PHRASE PARITY — the
//! property is that no phrase drifted away), (b) evaluates the shared phrase set — the
//! discriminator's exact semantics, `lowercased.contains(phrase)` — against z3's
//! resourceout literal and asserts detection. It ALSO asserts the root-cause property
//! that the per-phase copies are GONE (each consumer routes to the shared helper), so
//! drift cannot recur.

/// Extract the lowercase `contains("…")` phrase literals from the
