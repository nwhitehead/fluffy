//! Divergence pin (critic audit of #193 increment (iii), commit bf29a050): the
//! open-hole validator guards ONLY `check::check_file_with_options`. Every OTHER
//! path that lowers an exec-fn body bypasses it, and because a `?N` hole is
//! recorded on `FnItem.holes` and NOT threaded into the statement stream (no
//! `Stmt` variant — the deliberate #193 design), those paths lower the holed
//! body with the hole SILENTLY OMITTED: the hole vanishes into a syntactically
//! valid program with no trace.
//!
//! OBSERVED (live, this tree):
//! - `forge build` on `fn main() { ?0  42 }` emits an rlib ARTIFACT and a build
//!   manifest claiming `assurance: L1 (built, runtime-checked)` — exit 0, no
//!   mention of the open hole anywhere (`build::build_file` runs only the
//!   parse/validate/check_effects front, then `fluffy_lower::lower_l1`; it
//!   never consults `f.holes`).
//! - `forge body-tv` on the same file reports `main — faithful, 0 skipped`
//!   (exit 0): it lowers the hole-stripped body, ships it to verus, and certifies
//!   the TV verdict "faithful" for an INCOMPLETE body.
//! - (`forge exec-tv` corpus mode likewise reports the holed body's tail expr
//!   `faithful` — same root cause, pinned transitively by the same fix.)
//!
//! AUTHORITY:
//! - `.design/forge/goal-repl.md` REQ-4: "an item with any open hole is
//!   L0-equivalent until every hole is filled"; REQ-5: a holed item gets "no
//!   lowering, no verus"; Architecture: "A holed item NEVER reaches verus; it
//!   can never accidentally certify."
//! - `fluffy_syntax::ast` (`FnItem.holes` doc, shipped by bf29a050): "a holed
//!   item never lowers — it short-circuits at `forge check`" — the very
//!   invariant that justified omitting a `Stmt::Hole` variant. If ANY path
//!   lowers a holed body, the omission turns the hole into silent deletion.
//! - `fluffy-design.md` §6: "The certificate attached to a build artifact …
//!   This manifest **is** the deliverable's trust statement" — a build manifest
//!   asserting L1 for a fn whose body still carries an open goal is a false
//!   trust statement; §5.1: an open hole is an OPEN GOAL the oracle must
//!   re-present, never silently drop.
//!
//! These tests assert the AUTHORITY's behavior (a holed item never lowers: build
//! must refuse with a structured error, body-TV must never report a holed body
//! `faithful`) and therefore FAIL against the current toolchain.
//! Tracking: crosslink blocker (see issue filed with this commit).
