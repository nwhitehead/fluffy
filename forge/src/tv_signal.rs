//! `forge/src/tv_signal.rs` — the SHARED Verus/Z3 RESOURCE-LIMIT (rlimit) / timeout
//! signal discriminator for ALL THREE translation-validation check phases
//! (`forge/src/{contract_tv,body_tv,exec_tv}.rs`). Governed by
//! `.design/verified/exec-stmt-tv.md` REQ-5 (the body-TV four-way Faithful/Divergent/
//! Unverifiable/Skipped contract; R-HONEST-3 / R-CODE-4 — a Verus/Z3 timeout DEGRADES
//! and is reported, NEVER fabricated into a counterexample/Divergent). Tracking:
//! crosslink #192 (ref #166, #189).
//!
//! ## Why ONE helper (the #192 root cause)
//!
//! Before #192, EACH of the three TV phases carried its OWN private `is_rlimit_signal`
//! copy. The copies DRIFTED: `body_tv` (#189, the authority) matched THREE phrases;
//! `contract_tv` (#166) dropped `"resource limit exceeded"`; `exec_tv` had NO rlimit
//! gate at all (every `errors >= 1` run was mapped UNCONDITIONALLY to Divergent — the
//! #189-class bug). A drifted/missing discriminator fabricates a solver-budget
//! exhaustion into a contract/body/exec INFIDELITY — the exact false finding the #189
//! fix claims to close. The architectural fix: ONE shared discriminator, consumed by
//! all three phases, so the phrase set can NEVER drift again.
//!
//! ## The full phrase set (case-insensitive)
//!
//! - `"rlimit exceeded"` — verus's bare rlimit phrasing.
//! - `"rlimit) exceeded"` — verus's `Resource limit (rlimit) exceeded` (the `air`
//!   literal — the parenthesised tail `rlimit) exceeded`).
//! - `"resource limit exceeded"` — which ALSO catches the distributed z3 binary's OWN
//!   resourceout diagnostic `max. resource limit exceeded` (its `:reason-unknown`
//!   text on an rcounts exhaustion — present as a `strings` literal in the bundled
//!   `verus-x86-linux/z3`, independent of any Fluffy source). This is the
//!   load-bearing phrase #166's `contract_tv` copy had dropped and #189's `exec_tv`
//!   never had.
//!
//! ## REQ status
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | exec-stmt-tv REQ-5 (the rlimit discriminator — a Verus/Z3 timeout is Unverifiable, NEVER Divergent; R-HONEST-3 / R-CODE-4) | SHIPPED | `pub(crate) fn is_rlimit_signal` here is the SOLE discriminator. Non-test consumers: `contract_tv::discharge`, `body_tv::run_obligation`, `exec_tv::discharge` (all three TV-phase verus-discharge paths route an `errors >= 1` rlimit-hit run to their Unverifiable-equivalent verdict AHEAD of the Divergent arm). Verified by the `discriminator` unit tests here (each phrase detected; `postcondition not satisfied`/`assertion failed` NOT detected) + the per-phase `divergent_teeth` (rlimit → not Divergent) + `forge/tests/divergence_rlimit_phrase_drift.rs` (phrase parity + the z3 `max. resource limit exceeded` literal caught). |
