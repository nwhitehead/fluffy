//! `forge/src/mutation.rs` — §7 step 4 of the vacuity battery: mutation scoring
//! (`fluffy-design.md` §7 line 224, "operator flips, off-by-ones, early
//! returns, branch swaps — fixed deterministic mutator set"). Given a `fn` whose
//! REAL body already verifies L3, this module generates a FROZEN, DETERMINISTIC
//! set of mutants of that body (the contract UNTOUCHED), re-lowers + re-verifies
//! each against the same contract through the existing verus driver + proof
//! cache, and scores the **kill ratio** (`killed / scored`). A mutant verus
//! REJECTS is **killed** (the contract caught the wrong body — good); a mutant
//! verus PROVES is a **survivor** (the contract cannot tell the mutant from the
//! real body — too weak). A configurable floor (default 60%, §7) gates
//! certification: below the floor the item does NOT certify and the surviving
//! mutants are the precise strengthening prompt.
//!
//! Governing design: `.design/forge/mutation-scoring.md`.
//!
//! ## Polarity (the value-add)
//!
//! A mutant is a DELIBERATELY-WRONG body. If verus still PROVES it against the
//! contract, the contract is satisfied by both the right body and the wrong one
//! — it under-specifies. So `Proved` = SURVIVED = a hole in the contract; a
//! verus FAILURE = KILLED = the contract did its job (REQ-4). This is the same
//! polarity inversion #13's harnesses use, applied to the body.
//!
//! ## REQ status
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-1 (frozen deterministic mutator set) | SHIPPED | `pub fn generate` walks a `FnItem.body` in source order and applies the FIXED families: operator flips (`flip_binop`), off-by-ones (`IntLit n`→`n+1`/`n-1`, skip `n-1` at 0), early returns (`return <value>` via `early_return_value` at body head — scalar zero via `zero_value_for`, OR the empty-slice literal `&[]`/`&mut []` for a reference-to-slice return so EVERY real body is scored, #48), branch swaps (negate `if`/`Expr::If` cond, else swap arms). Consumer: `check::mutation_score` in `check.rs`. |
//! | REQ-2 (deterministic order + seed + cap) | SHIPPED | a pre-order walk in a fixed family order, capped by `pub const MUTANT_CAP`; selection is the first `MUTANT_CAP` mutants in enumeration order. The seam takes the pinned `check::DEFAULT_SOLVER_SEED` (recorded in the run; the enumeration is seed-stable). Consumer: `check::mutation_score`. |
//! | REQ-3 (re-lower + re-verify vs same contract) | SHIPPED | `pub fn generate` clones the original `FnItem` and mutates only `body`; `check::mutation_score` weaves each mutant via `item_subprogram` + `fluffy_lower::lower` and runs the existing `run_verus`. The `req`/`ens`/`inv`/`dec` are the original's, unchanged. |
//! | REQ-4 (KILLED vs SURVIVED) | SHIPPED | `pub fn classify_mutant` maps a `MutantOutcome`: `Proved` → SURVIVED, `Killed` (counterexample / timeout) → KILLED; a lowering failure is DROPPED (not scored). Consumer: `check::mutation_score`. |
//! | REQ-5 (kill ratio + floor gate, default 60%) | SHIPPED | `pub struct MutationScore` carries `killed`/`scored`/`survivor`; `pub fn MutationScore::kill_ratio` + `pub const MUTATION_FLOOR: f64 = 0.60`; `pub fn MutationScore::meets_floor`. A `0/0` score (no scoreable mutant) is BELOW the floor (`kill_ratio == 0.0`), not a vacuous pass — a contract that cannot be mutation-validated is gated `WeakContract` (#48, anti-Goodhart). The `cli` `--mutation-floor <FLOAT>` lever threads a non-default floor. Consumer: `check::mutation_score` + the floor gate in `check::check_file_with_options`. VERUS-ANCHORED (epic #60, REQ-11 / `.design/verified/self-verification.md` Target E): the f64 `meets_floor(0.60)` is anchored to the proved INTEGER cross-multiply `fluffy_verified::meets_floor_60` (the #48 `scored == 0 ⟹ !pass` is verus-proved integer-only) by the in-module `tests::verus_anchor` f64↔integer grid (`0..=20 × 0..=20`, Option B); the grid AGREES on every cell (OQ-E: 0 divergences — the cross-multiply is the exact rational test, the f64 boundary is conformance-tested not masked). |
//! | REQ-6 (graduate `mutants_killed`/`survivor`) | SHIPPED | `MutationScore::mutants_killed_string` builds the `"K/N"` form; `check` sets it via `Certificate::with_mutation_score` / `Certificate::rejected_weak_contract`. |
//! | REQ-7 (gate AFTER L3, reuse proof cache) | SHIPPED | `check::mutation_score` runs only on a `VerusOutcome::Proved` real body and content-addresses each mutant via `cache::cache_key`/`load`/`store`. |
//! | REQ-8 (deterministic kill ratio) | SHIPPED | `generate` is a pure function of the AST + the frozen table; each mutant verdict is the deterministic verus run the L3 path + cache rely on, so `mutants_killed` is deterministic (asserted by the same-input-twice conformance double-run). `mutants_killed`/`survivor` stay oracle-EXCLUDED (OQ-1). |
//!
//! ## Cluster C10 — ergonomics ripple (`.design/basis/11-ergonomics.md`, #112)
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-3 (MatchArm.guard ripple) | SHIPPED | `scan_expr`'s `Expr::Match` arm scans `arm.guard` (a guard is a mutable sub-expression — a guard mutant must be scoreable); `apply_expr`'s `Expr::Match` rebuild threads the mutation through `arm.guard`. `Pattern::Or` needs no mutation arm (mutation walks expressions, not patterns). Consumer: `mutation_score`. |
