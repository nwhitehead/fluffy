//! `forge/src/review.rs` — the PLUGGABLE SPEC-INTENT REVIEW SLOT (`forge review`,
//! `fluffy-design.md` §7 line 227, §summary line 298, issue #19). The §7
//! "residue surfaced for review": the one irreducible judgment the deterministic
//! battery (#6/#12/#13 vacuity + mutation pre-screening) cannot make — "is this
//! contract what you MEANT?".
//!
//! Governing design: `.design/forge/spec-review.md`.
//!
//! `forge review [item]` extracts the PRE-SCREENED DECLARATIVE SPEC LAYER for each
//! `fn` — the verbatim `req`/`ens`/`fx` clauses plus the DECLARATION (name, params,
//! return type, `dec` measure) of every DIRECTLY-referenced `spec fn`, with NO
//! bodies — and pairs each intent-reviewable contract with an "is this what you
//! meant?" prompt. It emits this as a machine artifact (`--json`, for a critic
//! model) and a human form, and defines the PLUGGABLE VERDICT SLOT
//! ([`ReviewVerdict`]) an EXTERNAL reviewer fills.
//!
//! Two data sources, both already shipped (mirroring `audit::AuditManifest`'s pure
//! projection):
//!
//! 1. The battery verdict — the `Vec<Certificate>` from [`crate::check::check_file`]
//!    (the SAME default-config pipeline `forge check`/`forge audit` run — no extra
//!    verification). The PRE-SCREENING predicate ([`is_intent_reviewable`]) reads
//!    `cert.reject`/`cert.level`: a cert is intent-reviewable iff it is reject-free
//!    AND a certified rung (`manifest::cert_certifies` — L1/L2/L3, incl. a slag /
//!    boundary L1 whose contract IS the trust statement, OQ-4). A battery-FAILING
//!    cert (`reject.is_some()`) is FLAGGED [`battery_failing`] with its
//!    `reject.cause` and is NOT surfaced for intent review (R-DEFER-9: the
//!    mechanical failure is answered first).
//! 2. The contract surface — the parsed `Program` (`fluffy_syntax::parse`). The
//!    spec layer is built from the verbatim `Clause.text` (`ast.rs`), and the
//!    spec-fn references are resolved by walking the contract clause `Expr`s for a
//!    callee name matching a top-level `Item::SpecFn`. EXCLUSION is STRUCTURAL: the
//!    projection reads `contract`/`name`/`params`/`ret`/`dec` and NEVER touches
//!    `FnItem.body`/`SpecFnItem.body`, so "no bodies" is enforced by which fields
//!    are read (parallel to `audit::FunctionRow::from_certificate`).
//!
//! forge NEVER produces the `aligned` verdict (R-CODE-5): the EXTRACTION (the
//! artifact) is a deterministic pure projection; the verdict is the external
//! reviewer's. The `--reviewer <cmd>` shell-out pipes the JSON artifact to the
//! reviewer's stdin and reads the [`ReviewVerdict`] JSON from its stdout, attaching
//! it as a SEPARATE `*.review.json` record — never a `Certificate` field (OQ-2: the
//! cert is the mechanical verdict; intent review is a separate judgment, never
//! conflated). A failing/absent reviewer cmd is a [`ForgeError`], never a panic.
//!
//! ## REQ status
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-1 (spec-layer extraction, no bodies) | SHIPPED | `pub fn review_file` → [`ReviewArtifact`]; [`SpecLayer::extract`] projects `FnItem.contract` (`req`/`ens`/`fx` verbatim `Clause.text`) + [`referenced_spec_fns`] (the directly-referenced `SpecFnItem` declarations: name/params/ret/`dec`, NO body). `FnItem.body`/`SpecFnItem.body` are never read. Consumer: `cli::run_review`. |
//! | REQ-2 (pre-screening — only battery-passing) | SHIPPED | [`is_intent_reviewable`] (= `manifest::cert_certifies`: reject-free + certified rung) partitions certs; a `reject.is_some()` cert becomes a [`BatteryFailing`] flag carrying `reject.cause`, NOT an [`IntentReview`]. Consumer: `review_file`. |
//! | REQ-3 (per-contract intent prompt) | SHIPPED | [`IntentReview::prompt`] names the item + frames the only-open-question as spec-intent alignment; built in [`IntentReview::new`]. Consumer: `cli::render_review`. |
//! | REQ-4 (pluggable verdict slot — separate record) | SHIPPED | [`ReviewVerdict { item, aligned, note }`] + [`ReviewRecord`] (the separate `*.review.json` document); attached by [`attach_verdicts`], written to `<file>.review.json` by `cli::run_review`. NEVER a `Certificate` field (the cert's `oracle_subset` is untouched). |
//! | REQ-5 (dual emission machine + human) | SHIPPED | [`ReviewArtifact`] derives `Serialize` (the `--json` machine form); `cli::render_review` is the human form. Consumer: `cli::run_review`. |
//! | REQ-6 (determinism, R-CODE-5) | SHIPPED | [`review_file`] is a pure projection of the parsed program + the cert collection; spec-fn references are resolved into a sorted-deduplicated set ([`referenced_spec_fns`]); no wall-clock, no model call. The EXTRACTION is byte-identical across runs. |
//! | REQ-7 (`forge review [item]` command + dispatch + --reviewer) | SHIPPED | `cli::parse_args`'s `review` verb + `cli::run_review`; [`run_reviewer`] is the `--reviewer <cmd>` shell-out (artifact → stdin, `ReviewVerdict` ← stdout); a spawn/parse failure is a `ForgeError`, never a panic. |
//!
//! ## Cluster C10 — ergonomics ripple (`.design/basis/11-ergonomics.md`, #112)
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-3 (MatchArm.guard ripple) | SHIPPED | `collect_callee_names`'s `Expr::Match` arm walks `arm.guard` (a guard may CALL a fn — its callees are part of the review surface). `Pattern::Or` needs no review arm (review walks expressions, not patterns). Consumer: `review_file`. |
