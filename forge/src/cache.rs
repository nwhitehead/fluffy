//! `forge/src/cache.rs` — the per-item, content-addressed proof cache and the
//! home of the bit-reproducible-verification contract (`fluffy-design.md`
//! §5.3: "Proof results are content-addressed and cached per item").
//!
//! For each `.th` item, `check::check_file` computes a STABLE cache key from the
//! four inputs that determine that item's verdict — the item's LOWERED Verus
//! source, the pinned solver seed, the verus version, and the fluffy toolchain
//! version — consults the cache BEFORE spawning verus, returns the stored
//! [`Certificate`] on a HIT (skipping the solver), and stores the result on a
//! MISS. The cache is a PERFORMANCE optimization that NEVER changes a verdict: a
//! hit is indistinguishable from a fresh verify (`goal.md` R-DEFER-9 — no proof
//! cheats; the cache cannot fabricate a verdict).
//!
//! Governing design: `.design/forge/proof-cache.md`.
//!
//! This module is a thin, deterministic, content-addressed store with NO
//! verification logic of its own — it sits BETWEEN `check::item_subprogram` /
//! `fluffy_lower::lower` (which produce the lowered source it content-addresses)
//! and `check::run_verus` (the solver invocation it lets `forge` skip on a hit).
//! IO failures DEGRADE to a MISS, never a panic (R-CODE-2): a damaged cache is
//! "slower," never "wrong" or "crashes."
//!
//! ## REQ status
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-1 (cache-key composition — verdict-determining inputs) | SHIPPED | `pub fn cache_key(lowered_src, seed, verus_version, fluffy_version) -> String` hashes the four args PLUS the `CHECK_SCHEMA_VERSION` check-logic version (blocker #49), each DOMAIN-TAGGED + LENGTH-PREFIXED (`field`), into a lowercase-hex sha256 content address. Consumer: `check::check_file`. |
//! | REQ-2 (soundness-completeness invariant — hit == fresh verify) | SHIPPED | `cache_key` captures every verdict-determining input (the four args); `store` clears `cached` before persisting and `load` returns the stored cert unchanged, so `check::check_file`'s `with_cached(true)` HIT is oracle-equal to the fresh verify it was stored from. Verified by `key_changes_when_any_input_changes` + `check::check_file`'s `with_cached` wiring. |
//! | REQ-3 (lookup-then-store flow, per item) | SHIPPED | `pub fn load(cache_dir, key) -> Option<Certificate>` consulted BEFORE `run_verus`; `pub fn store(cache_dir, key, cert)` after a MISS. Consumer: `check::check_file`'s per-item L3 path. |
//! | REQ-4 (locality — per-item) | SHIPPED | the key is over the item's OWN `item_subprogram` lowered source (`check.rs`), so an edit to a sibling leaves this item's key byte-identical. Verified by `check::tests::cache_key_is_local_to_the_item`. |
//! | REQ-5 (version-keyed invalidation) | SHIPPED | `verus_version` + `fluffy_version` (`env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`, sourced in `check.rs`) are key inputs; a version change forces a universal MISS. Verified by `key_changes_when_any_input_changes`. |
//! | REQ-6 (cache location + format — gitignore-able) | SHIPPED | `pub fn default_cache_dir() -> PathBuf` = `target/fluffy-proof-cache/` (under the already-ignored `target/`); one `<hex-key>.json` per key; `store` writes atomically (temp + rename); a corrupt/unreadable entry → `load` returns `None` (MISS, never an error). Consumer: `check::check_file`. |
//! | REQ-7 (additive `cached: bool` field) | SHIPPED | `manifest::Certificate::cached` (`#[serde(default)]`, oracle-excluded); `store` persists `cached: false` (a stored cert is the canonical fresh verify), `check::check_file` sets `with_cached(true)` on the HIT it returns. |
//! | REQ-8 (bit-reproducible deterministic cert) | SHIPPED | `cache_key` is a PURE function of its four inputs (no wall-clock, no ambient state, R-CODE-5); `load`/`store` round-trip the cert's deterministic fields byte-for-byte. Verified by `cache_key_is_pure` + `round_trip_load_store`. |
