//! `forge/src/engine.rs` — the backend-NEUTRAL proof-Engine interface + the Verus
//! engine refactored behind it (`.design/verified/proof-backends.md` REQ-2/REQ-3/
//! REQ-3.1/REQ-8; increment (i), blocker #204).
//!
//! Today exactly one engine is welded into `check::check_file_with_options` (the
//! implicit `run_verus` + `classify_verus_outcome` path). This module introduces
//! the [`Engine`] trait — the four slots REQ-2 names (FRAGMENT / DISCHARGE / TRUST
//! PROFILE / EVIDENCE) — and refactors the Verus discharge BYTE-IDENTICALLY behind
//! it, with the ONE named exception of the REQ-3.1 fast-unknown remap.
//!
//! **The REQ-3.1 fast-unknown seam (the single behavioral delta).** The SHIPPED
//! `classify_verus_outcome` absorbs the SMT incompleteness-`unknown` into its
//! `Counterexample` bucket (an `unknown` returned FAST, no `--profile` report → the
//! failure path). A naive byte-identical Verus engine would map that
//! `Counterexample` to [`Verdict::Refuted`] → `ladder_action_l3` HARD FAIL — which
//! CONTRADICTS REQ-3 ("an SMT `unknown` is `Unknown`, never `Refuted`; refutation
//! requires a witnessing input"). So [`VerusEngine::verdict_of`] SPLITS the
//! `Counterexample` by [`counterexample_is_incompleteness_unknown`], the NARROW
//! SMT-`unknown` signature: ONLY a span-less failure carrying the SMT-`unknown`
//! signal (no parsed `--> file:line:col` span AND no frontend `error[E…]` type
//! error) → [`Verdict::Unknown`] (DEGRADE, matching §6's degrade-on-incompleteness
//! intent); a WITNESSED countermodel (a parsed span) AND a FRONTEND rejection (a
//! type error `error[E…]`) both stay [`Verdict::Refuted`] (HARD FAIL, never
//! degrades).
//!
//! **Why the narrow signature (cert-oracle byte-identity).** The remap is the SOLE
//! exception to increment (i)'s byte-identical claim, and it MUST be inert on the
//! conformance corpus. The corpus DOES contain `Counterexample`-bucket failures —
//! notably the provenance `careless_query` IFC path, which verus rejects with a
//! span-less type error `error[E0308]` the corpus pins at L0. A coarse "no parsed
//! span → Unknown" rule would WRONGLY degrade that E0308 to L2 (and crash on the
//! ADT L2 lowering), perturbing the oracle. The narrow signature keeps E0308 (and
//! every witnessed countermodel) at `Refuted` → L0, so it fires ONLY on a genuine
//! SMT-`unknown` — a case the corpus does not contain — leaving every
//! `conformance/*.cert.json` byte-identical (REQ-3.1's "the remap only changes
//! behavior on inputs the corpus doesn't contain").
//!
//! ## REQ status
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-2 (the Engine interface — 4 slots) | SHIPPED (Verus instance) | `pub trait Engine { name, fragment, discharge, trust_profile, evidence_key }` + `pub enum Verdict`/`Evidence`/`Counterexample`/`Reason` + `pub struct TrustProfile`/`Fragment`/`CacheKey`; the `pub struct VerusEngine` fills all four slots from SHIPPED code (FRAGMENT = the frozen lowering subset; DISCHARGE = `classify_verus_outcome`'s three-way map lifted to `Verdict` with the REQ-3.1 remap; TRUST PROFILE = {Z3, Verus VC-gen} + the TV/lowering theorem; EVIDENCE = the content-addressed `cache::cache_key` generalized with an engine discriminator). Non-test consumer: `check::ladder_for_timeout` routes the per-item L3 certification discharge through `VerusEngine`. The Lean engine (`LeanAuto`/`LeanInteractive`) is increment (ii), NOT-STARTED. |
//! | REQ-3 (discharge discipline — Unknown degrades, Refuted hard-fails) | SHIPPED | `pub fn verdict_ladder_action` maps a `Verdict` to the SHIPPED `degrade::L3Verdict` for a `role = Certification` obligation: `Proven` → the proved L3 cert (CertifyL3); `Unknown` → `Timeout`-shaped degrade trigger (`run_ladder` → L2/L1); `Refuted` → `Counterexample` (HARD FAIL, never degrades). Consumer: `check::ladder_for_timeout`. Generalized off `degrade::ladder_action_l3`. |
//! | REQ-3.1 (the fast-unknown remap) | SHIPPED | `VerusEngine::verdict_of` splits `VerusOutcome::Counterexample` by `counterexample_is_incompleteness_unknown` (the NARROW SMT-`unknown` signature): ONLY a span-less failure carrying the SMT-`unknown` signal (no frontend `error[E` / no parsed `--> span`) → `Unknown(Reason::IncompleteUnknown)` (degrade); a witnessed countermodel AND a frontend type error (E0308) stay `Refuted` (hard-fail). The remap is INERT on the corpus (witnessed + E0308 cases stay hard-fail). Tested: a synthetic SMT-`unknown` degrades, a witnessed countermodel + an E0308 type error both hard-fail (`engine.rs` tests + `forge/tests/engine_interface.rs`). |
//! | REQ-8 (engine ordering hook) | SHIPPED (Verus rung) | `pub fn default_engines` returns the ordered engine list (Verus first); increment (i) wires the hook with the single Verus rung, increment (ii) adds the Lean rungs. Consumer: `check::ladder_for_timeout` reads the first engine (Verus). |
