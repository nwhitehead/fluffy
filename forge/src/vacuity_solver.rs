//! `forge/src/vacuity_solver.rs` — the SOLVER-backed layer of the §7 vacuity
//! battery (`fluffy-design.md` §7 steps 2-3): **tautology** detection and
//! **vacuous-precondition** detection. It runs as a gate stage in `forge check`
//! AFTER #6's FREE structural triage (`forge/src/vacuity.rs`) returns
//! `ProceedToL3` and BEFORE the item's own L3 proof. A contract that survives the
//! syntactic checks may still be SEMANTICALLY degenerate:
//!
//! - a postcondition that holds for an ARBITRARY result (`ens result >= 0` for a
//!   `u32`) says nothing about what the function computes → a **tautology**;
//! - a requirement that is unsatisfiable (`req x > 5 && x < 3`) means the function
//!   can never be called and its contract is vacuously true → a **vacuous
//!   precondition**.
//!
//! These are the SOLVER counterparts of #6's syntactic moves (which catch
//! `ens true` / `x == x` / `ens` literally equal to a `req` conjunct). #13 catches
//! the logical versions the syntax misses. This is the anti-Goodhart machinery
//! (`goal.md` R-DEFER-9: the §7 battery exists to catch the gaming move of a
//! logically-vacuous contract).
//!
//! Both checks REUSE the existing Verus contract lowering: each builds a one-query
//! `proof fn` harness by lowering the REAL item via `fluffy_lower::lower` (so the
//! emitted `requires`/`ensures` text is byte-identical to the real proof's, with
//! the combinator + `spec fn` weaving the lowerer already performs) and splicing
//! that verbatim contract into the harness frame. The harness is run through verus
//! and the verdict interpreted (REQ-3): a genuine verus SUCCESS is the BAD news
//! (the contract is degenerate → reject). A verus FAILURE is CLEAN. A timeout /
//! environment error is NEVER silently read as either "tautology" or "clean".
//!
//! Governing design: `.design/forge/solver-vacuity.md`.
//!
//! ## REQ status
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-1 (tautology harness builder) | SHIPPED | `build_tautology_harness` lowers the real `FnItem` (+ spec fns) via `fluffy_lower::lower`, extracts the verbatim `requires`/`ensures` + the lowered param list / return type (`extract_lowered_fn`), and rebuilds `proof fn taut_check(<params>, result: <RET>) requires ..; ensures ..; { }`. Consumer: `solver_vacuity_check` → `check::check_file`. Grounded: PROVES on `result >= 0`/`u32`, FAILS on `sum`'s ens. |
//! | REQ-2 (vacuity harness builder) | SHIPPED | `build_vacuity_harness` reuses the same extraction and rebuilds `proof fn vac_check(<params>) requires ..; { assert(false); }`. Consumer: `solver_vacuity_check` → `check::check_file`. Grounded: PROVES on `x>5 && x<3`, FAILS on `sum`'s req. |
//! | REQ-3 (verdict interpretation, R-CODE-4) | SHIPPED | `interpret_summary` maps a `HarnessSummary`: PROVED (`success && errors==0`) → `Proved` (DETECTED); FAILED → `Failed` (CLEAN); VIR error → `ForgeError::VerusOutput`. `run_harness` surfaces verus-absent / unparseable output as a `ForgeError`, NEVER a silent clean `false`. |
//! | REQ-4 (value-add over #6) | SHIPPED | the `semantic_tautology` / `vacuous_precondition` fixtures PASS `vacuity::triage` (no #6 syntactic cause) yet `solver_vacuity_check` rejects them — asserted by `forge/tests/solver_vacuity_conformance.rs` against `conformance/solver-vacuity/cases.json`. |
//! | REQ-5 (gate wiring, verdict-in-cert) | SHIPPED | `solver_vacuity_check` is the single entry `check::check_file` calls after #6 triage / before L3 (inside the cache-miss branch); a `Detected` → `Certificate::rejected_vacuity` (`Level::L0` + the `SemanticTautology`/`VacuousPrecondition` cause + the matching `contract_quality` bool true); a `Clean` proceeds to L3. |
//! | REQ-6 (graduate the two bools to solver-confirmed) | SHIPPED | a `Detected` sets the matching `contract_quality` bool `true` on the reject cert via `Certificate::rejected_vacuity`; a `Clean` proceeds to the L3 path whose `graduate_triage_clean` keeps both bools live-`false` (now solver-confirmed). |
//! | REQ-7 (determinism + one query/check) | SHIPPED | `run_harness` passes the pinned `seed` + `rlimit` to verus (`check::DEFAULT_SOLVER_SEED`/`DEFAULT_RLIMIT`); the verdict is deterministic for a fixed toolchain + seed (R-CODE-5). At most two verus queries per `fn` (vacuity then tautology, short-circuiting on the first detection) — the documented §11 accepted cost. |

/// Run one harness through verus and classify the outcome (REQ-3/REQ-7). Writes
/// the harness to a `<stem>.rs` file with a valid crate-name stem INSIDE a per-run
/// scratch DIRECTORY, spawns verus there with the pinned `seed` + `rlimit` +
/// `--output-json`, parses the `verification-results` summary, and maps it via
/// [`interpret_summary`].
///
/// Cleanup is WHOLESALE (blocker #53): verus compiles the harness `.rs` into a
/// ~4.3M binary SIBLING in its working directory, and a SUCCEEDING harness query
/// (a tautology fn / an unsat-`req` fn — the rejected cases the #13 gate runs on
/// every fn) leaves that binary orphaned. So the run gets its OWN scratch dir
/// (source + compiled binary + any artifact all land inside, via `current_dir`)
/// and the [`crate::check::ScratchDir`] Drop guard removes it WHOLESALE on EVERY
/// exit path — success, a clean FAILED, OR a `?` early-return on an environment/IO
/// error. Reuses `check.rs`'s #53 guard (DRY — the identical fix). Cleanup is
/// best-effort (`Drop` does a `let _ = remove_dir_all`), never a panic (R-CODE-2):
/// a removal failure must not mask the real verus result.
///
/// R-CODE-4: every environment / internal failure surfaces a `ForgeError` and is
/// NEVER read as either "tautology" or "clean":
/// - verus absent on spawn → `ForgeError::VerusAbsent`;
/// - unparseable `--output-json` (no `verification-results`) → `ForgeError::VerusOutput`;
/// - a VIR / internal verus error → `ForgeError::VerusOutput`.
///
/// A verus TIMEOUT (rlimit exhausted) is an UNDETERMINED query: its summary is a
/// non-success WITHOUT a VIR error, which [`interpret_summary`] maps to `Failed`
/// (CLEAN). This is the conservative reading (OQ-3): an inconclusive vacuity query
/// does NOT reject the contract (it is NOT proven degenerate), and a timeout is
/// never read as "tautology". These harnesses are tiny single queries, so a
/// timeout at the generous pinned rlimit is unlikely; the polarity is sound (a
/// hard-to-DISprove tautology stays unrejected — a missed detection, the
