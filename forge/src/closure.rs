//! `forge/src/closure.rs` — the §9 end-to-end vs to-the-boundary classification
//! (issue #17, `.design/forge/e2e-vs-boundary.md`; `fluffy-design.md` §9).
//!
//! `fluffy-design.md` §9 promises the manifest distinguishes "verified to the
//! boundary" from "verified, period". This module computes, for each `fn` in a
//! parsed file, its **transitive intra-file call closure** and classifies the
//! function's *assurance scope*:
//!
//! - **END-TO-END** ("verified, period") — nothing in the closure is a
//!   `#[boundary]` (foreign, unproven body, #16) or `#[slag]` (trusted-by-fiat
//!   body, #6) fn. Every link is a proved / `spec fn` / combinator body, so the
//!   whole-program guarantee rests only on the toolchain.
//! - **TO-THE-BOUNDARY** ("verified to the boundary") — the closure transitively
//!   reaches a `#[boundary]` or `#[slag]` fn. The fn's own contract is verified,
//!   but the end-to-end guarantee crosses a foreign/unproven body at the crossing
//!   (`goal.md` R-DEFER-9: HONESTLY mark a guarantee that depends on an unproven
//!   foreign body — never claim end-to-end when a boundary is reached).
//!
//! The analysis is PURE and structural: it owns NO prover invocation and changes
//! NO verdict. It LAYERS the §9 composition rule on top of the per-fn verdicts
//! `check::check_file` already produced — the result is recorded as the additive
//! `Certificate::assurance_scope` field ([`crate::manifest::AssuranceScope`]).
//!
//! ## What is PURE, what is a CROSSING (`.design/forge/e2e-vs-boundary.md`)
//!
//! - Nodes are the file's `Item::Fn` and `Item::SpecFn`.
//! - Edges come from walking each `fn` body's `Expr::Call` / `Expr::MethodCall`
//!   (and every nested expression / statement) and resolving the callee by NAME.
//! - A callee resolving to an in-file `Item::SpecFn` is PURE (a `spec fn` is total
//!   / terminating / body-Fluffy-verified, §4.2 — never a crossing, even when
//!   self-recursive like `spec_sum`).
//! - A callee resolving to a registry combinator (`forall_in`, `sorted`, … — the
//!   `fluffy_spec` set, §4.2) is PURE (a frozen-trigger proved library).
//! - A callee resolving to an in-file `Item::Fn` that is `#[boundary]` / `#[slag]`
//!   is a CROSSING; an in-file pure `Item::Fn` inherits ITS closure.
//! - A callee resolving to nothing in-file and not a combinator (a cross-file
//!   callee) is PURE/IGNORED, NOT a crossing (OQ-1: cross-file resolution is a
//!   documented v0.1 limitation).
//!
//! The walk is cycle-safe (a visited set keyed by fn name; recursion does not
//! loop) and bounded (each node touched once), so it is O(nodes + edges) and
//! DETERMINISTIC (R-CODE-5: a pure function of the parsed `Program`, no wall-clock
//! / unordered iteration in the verdict — the `via` crossing is the first reached
//! in source order, and the result is keyed in a `BTreeMap`).
//!
//! ## REQ status
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-1 (transitive call closure, cycle-safe + bounded) | SHIPPED | `pub fn classify` builds `CallGraph::from_program` (walks `Expr::Call`/`MethodCall` via `collect_calls`/`walk_expr`/`walk_block`, resolving in-file callees by name; a `spec fn` / combinator / unresolved callee is PURE), then `reach_crossing` does a cycle-safe DFS (a `visited` `BTreeSet` keyed by name; a self/mutual-recursive node is touched once). Consumer: `check::check_file_with_options` (attaches each cert's `assurance_scope`). |
//! | REQ-2 (END-TO-END vs TO-THE-BOUNDARY rule) | SHIPPED | `classify` maps each `Item::Fn` to `AssuranceScope::EndToEnd` iff `reach_crossing` finds NO `#[boundary]`/`#[slag]` fn in its closure, else `AssuranceScope::ToBoundary { via }` recording the first reached crossing. A `#[boundary]`/`#[slag]` fn is itself the crossing (`via` is itself). |
//! | REQ-3 (per-fn additive cert field) | SHIPPED | `AssuranceScope` (in `manifest.rs`) is the additive `Certificate::assurance_scope` field; this module produces the value, `check.rs` attaches it. |
//! | REQ-4 (project-level claim) | SHIPPED | `degrade.rs`'s `AssuranceManifest::aggregate` computes `ProjectScope` from the per-fn scopes (END-TO-END iff every fn is). |
//! | REQ-5 (scope ⊥ level) | SHIPPED | `classify` reads only the call graph (`#[boundary]`/`#[slag]` syntactic flags) — never a cert `Level`; `check.rs` attaches the scope ALONGSIDE the achieved level, so an L3 fn whose closure crosses a boundary is `ToBoundary` at `Level::L3`. |
//! | REQ-6 (determinism) | SHIPPED | `classify` returns a `BTreeMap<String, AssuranceScope>` (sorted, stable); the `via` crossing is the FIRST reached in source-order DFS (`reach_crossing` iterates callees in source order, visited-guarded). A pure function of the `Program` — no wall-clock / unordered map in the verdict (R-CODE-5). |
//!
//! ## #52 reuse note (`.design/lower/boundary-composition.md`)
//!
//! The private `CallGraph::from_program` + the cycle-safe DFS are now ALSO
//! consumed by the §9 boundary-composition weaving (#52): `pub fn
//! reachable_in_file_fns` reuses the SAME walker (a new `CallGraph::reachable_fns`
//! DFS sibling of `reach_crossing`) to return every in-file `Item::Fn` a caller
//! transitively references, which `check::item_subprogram` weaves into the
//! caller's §5.3 sub-program (regular fns with their real body, boundary/slag fns
//! as `#[verifier::external_body]` signatures). No walker is duplicated.
//!
//! ## Cluster C10 — ergonomics ripple (`.design/basis/11-ergonomics.md`, #112)
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-3 (MatchArm.guard ripple) | SHIPPED | `walk_expr`'s `Expr::Match` arm walks `arm.guard` (a guard may CALL a fn — its callee crosses into the call graph / closure surface). `Pattern::Or` needs no closure arm (the call-graph walk is over expressions). Consumer: `classify` / `reachable_in_file_fns`. |
