//! `forge/src/repair.rs` — the background L1/L2 → L3 proof-repair loop (issue #18,
//! `.design/forge/proof-repair.md`; `fluffy-design.md` §6, Appendix B). Once a
//! `forge check` run has left an item BELOW L3 because verus could not PROVE it
//! within its resource budget (a TIMEOUT — INCONCLUSIVENESS, the #10 ladder /
//! #11 classification), repair tries to drive that item back UP to L3 by the one
//! mechanical, checkable move §6 sanctions: BUDGET ESCALATION. It re-verifies the
//! item along a FIXED, BOUNDED geometric `--rlimit` ladder (reusing the SAME
//! `check.rs` verus driver); the first budget at which the item PROVES is a real
//! upgrade to L3 (the winning budget is recorded). An item that never proves even
//! at the cap stays sub-L3 and repair surfaces the #11 repair PROMPT (the
//! `SolverProfile` + `suggested_move` + the failing obligation) for the agent's
//! own move (a custom proof hint).
//!
//! **THE ANTI-CHEAT INVARIANT (R-DEFER-9, §12 — the load-bearing property).**
//! Repair escalates a TIMEOUT and NOTHING ELSE. A COUNTEREXAMPLE (verus DISPROVED
//! the contract — `postcondition not satisfied`, NO profile report), a vacuity
//! reject (`rejected_vacuity`), a weak-contract reject (`rejected_weak_contract`),
//! and any non-timeout sub-L3 status are HARD FAILS: repair REPORTS them and NEVER
//! retries them at a higher budget, NEVER upgrades them to L3. More budget never
//! makes a false thing true. The gate is [`classify_sub_l3`] returning
//! [`SubL3Status::Timeout`] (the SOLE trigger for [`escalate`]); every other
//! verdict short-circuits to [`SubL3Status::NotRepairable`] and the escalation
//! closure is NEVER invoked. This is the exact dual of the #10 down-ladder's
//! anti-cheat (`degrade.rs`): inconclusiveness moves, falsity does not.
//!
//! This module COMPOSES the shipped pieces; it owns NO new prover-invocation
//! logic — it re-drives `check::check_file_with_rlimit` (the `--rlimit` seam, #11)
//! at each escalated rung, maps the resulting `Certificate` into a
//! [`RepairVerdict`], and reads the #11 `SolverProfile`/`suggested_move` off a
//! still-failing cert for the prompt.
//!
//! ## REQ status
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-1 (`forge repair [item]` upgrade loop) | SHIPPED | `pub fn repair_file` runs `check::check_file_with_rlimit(path, DEFAULT_RLIMIT)`, classifies each cert via `classify_sub_l3`, and for a `SubL3Status::Timeout` drives `escalate` along [`REPAIR_LADDER`], upgrading to L3 on the first rung that PROVES (recording the budget) else surfacing the prompt. Consumer: `cli::run_repair` (`cli.rs`). |
//! | REQ-2 (anti-cheat: only a TIMEOUT is retried) | SHIPPED | `classify_sub_l3` returns `Timeout` ONLY for a `VerusTimeout` reject / a `lowered_assurance` (`VerusTimeout` degrade) cert; a counterexample / vacuity / weak-contract reject / un-discharged `L0` returns `NotRepairable`. `escalate` is called ONLY on `Timeout` (gated in `repair_item`), so the escalation closure NEVER runs for a non-timeout. Tests `counterexample_is_never_retried` + `rejects_are_never_retried`. |
//! | REQ-3 (bounded escalation ladder) | SHIPPED | [`REPAIR_LADDER`] is a frozen `[f64; 4]` of `--rlimit` multipliers (`2,4,8,16`); `escalate` iterates it in order and STOPS at the cap, so it ALWAYS terminates per item (a never-proving timeout makes exactly `REPAIR_LADDER.len()` attempts). Test `escalation_is_bounded_and_terminates`. |
//! | REQ-4 (cache-backed re-verify) | SHIPPED | each rung calls `check::check_file_with_rlimit` at a NON-default (escalated) budget, which `check.rs` documents bypasses the cache (a budget-dependent verdict is never cached as the canonical proof); per OQ-2 reading (a), escalated verifies are uncached in the v0.5 kernel. |
//! | REQ-5 (determinism of the achieved level) | SHIPPED | [`REPAIR_LADDER`] is a const + the per-rung verdict is the deterministic `check::classify_verus_outcome` under the pinned seed, so the achieved level + the recorded winning budget are a deterministic function of the item + the ladder (R-CODE-5). Test `escalation_is_deterministic`. |
//! | REQ-6 (the repair report) | SHIPPED | `pub struct RepairReport { items: Vec<RepairItem> }` with `enum RepairOutcome { UpgradedToL3 { budget }, StillSubL3 { level, prompt }, NotRepairable { reason } }`; an already-L3 item is a NO-OP (not in `items`). Consumer: `cli::run_repair` + `cli::render_repair`. |
//! | REQ-7 (subprocess failure is an error, never an upgrade) | SHIPPED | `escalate`'s verifier closure returns `Result<RepairVerdict, ForgeError>`; an environment failure (`VerusAbsent`/`VerusOutput`) propagates via the `?` out of `repair_file`, NEVER a still-sub-L3 verdict and NEVER a silent upgrade (R-CODE-4). Test `environment_error_propagates`. |
