//! `forge/src/cli.rs` — the command surface of the `forge` driver. It parses
//! `argv` with a minimal hand-rolled matcher (REQ-2, NOT a derive macro),
//! dispatches `forge new <name>` and `forge check [<file>] [--json]`, renders the
//! certificate as human-readable text or (under `--json`) the §5.1 structured
//! JSON, and owns [`ForgeError`] — the BOUNDARY error that aggregates each driven
//! crate's error (`fluffy_syntax::SyntaxError`, `fluffy_spec::SpecError`,
//! `fluffy_lower::LowerError`) plus driver-native verus/io/usage variants.
//!
//! Governing design: `.design/forge/cli.md`.
//!
//! ## REQ status
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-1 (command surface) | SHIPPED | `run` matches `new`/`check`; an unknown verb → `ForgeError::Usage`; the other Appendix B verbs are out of #5. Consumer: `main::main`. |
//! | REQ-2 (hand-rolled arg parsing) | SHIPPED | `parse_args` is a `match` over the verb + positionals + the `--json` / `--level` / `--rlimit` flags; no `clap` dependency in `forge/Cargo.toml`. The #11 `--rlimit <FLOAT>` flag tunes the verus SMT resource budget (default `check::DEFAULT_RLIMIT`); a low value forces the timeout path (`run_check` → `check::check_file_with_rlimit`). |
//! | REQ-3 (`ForgeError` aggregation) | SHIPPED | `enum ForgeError` wraps `Vec<SyntaxError>`/`Vec<SpecError>`/`Vec<LowerError>`/`LowerError` and carries `VerusAbsent`/`VerusSpawn`/`VerusOutput`/`Io`/`Usage`; `Display` forwards each inner error's diagnostic (no information lost). |
//! | REQ-4 (human + `--json` output) | SHIPPED | `render_human` / `serde_json::to_string_pretty` of the cert array; `run_check` picks the rendering from `--json`; diagnostics go to stderr so `--json` stdout is a clean document. |
//! | REQ-5 (typed exit codes) | SHIPPED | `run_check` maps the #10 `AssuranceManifest::aggregate` headline to an `ExitCode`: `ProjectAssurance::Certified(_)` (every item certified at `L3`/`L2`/`L1` with no `reject`, via `manifest::cert_certifies`) → 0; `ProjectAssurance::Failed` (any #6 triage / slag reject, un-discharged proof, or counterexample) → `EXIT_VERIFICATION_FAILURE`; environment/usage/IO → `EXIT_ENVIRONMENT`. |
//!
//! ## #10 gate (the project assurance display, this iteration)
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | degrade-ladder REQ-5/REQ-6 (display the project assurance) | SHIPPED | `run_check` computes `manifest::AssuranceManifest::aggregate(&certs)` and `render_assurance` prints the project headline (the min-over-functions, or `FAILED` when any fn does not certify) + the per-fn `lowered-assurance` flags (§5.2 "displayed on every build"). The headline also drives the exit code (REQ-5). |
//! | REQ-6 (no panics; Result discipline) | SHIPPED | every fallible path returns `Result<_, ForgeError>`; no `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` outside `#[cfg(test)]`; verus exit status inspected in `check.rs`. |
//! | REQ-7 (`forge new` scaffold) | SHIPPED | `scaffold_project` writes `forge.toml` + `forge.lock` (pinned seed, §5.3) + `FLUFFY.skill.pin`; refuses a non-empty target (`ForgeError::Usage`). |
