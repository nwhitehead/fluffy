//! `forge/src/obligation.rs` — the backend-NEUTRAL verification obligation
//! artifact (`.design/verified/proof-backends.md` REQ-1/REQ-1.2; increment (i),
//! blocker #204).
//!
//! Today the obligation content the pipeline discharges exists only transiently,
//! materialized as Verus TEXT (`fluffy-tv/src/obligation.rs`'s
//! `equivalence_obligation` family). This module REIFIES that same content as a
//! prover-NEUTRAL value (see the "honest scope" note below on serialization): an
//! [`Obligation`] carries the item, its
//! obligation [`ObligationClass`], the [`ObligationRole`], the AST slice it is
//! stated over (a `fluffy-syntax` node, NOT a Verus string), and a prover-neutral
//! [`ObligationEnv`] (the generalization of `fluffy-tv`'s `ObligationFrame` —
//! AST nodes + Fluffy types + coercion flags, NOT rendered Verus text). An
//! engine (`engine.rs`) RENDERS it into its own input language (Verus text for the
//! Verus engine; Lean source for the future Lean engine — increment (ii)).
//!
//! The load-bearing inversion (§1): the obligation STOPS being Verus-shaped. The
//! Verus rendering (`obligation.rs`'s `param_list`/`spec_defs`/`as nat` rewrite)
//! becomes the Verus engine's `render`, not the artifact itself.
//!
//! **A note on "serializable" (REQ-1, honest scope).** The load-bearing property
//! increment (i) delivers is prover-NEUTRALITY: the artifact carries `fluffy-
//! syntax` AST nodes + Fluffy `Type`s + coercion flags, NOT any prover's rendered
//! text. The `fluffy-syntax` AST does NOT derive `serde` in production (serde is a
//! dev-dependency there — `fluffy-syntax/Cargo.toml`), and adding it is outside
//! the #204 manifest, so the artifact is a prover-neutral in-memory VALUE
//! (`Clone + PartialEq + Eq`), not a wire-serialized one. The Verus engine consumes
//! the `&Obligation` directly and keys its evidence on the LOWERED source (the
//! SHIPPED `cache::cache_key` substrate — §2(d)); wire serialization of the artifact
//! is increment (ii) work, when the Lean exporter serializes a Lean theorem (a
//! string), not the raw AST. The env's prover-neutral SCALAR content is what the
//! engine renders; that content is fully inspectable + comparable here.
//!
//! ## REQ status
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-1 (the backend-neutral Obligation artifact) | SHIPPED | `pub struct Obligation { item, class, role, ast_slice, env }` + `pub enum ObligationClass`/`ObligationRole` + `pub struct ObligationEnv`/`ObligationParam` here, prover-neutral (the `ast_slice` is an `AstSlice` of `fluffy-syntax` nodes; the env carries Fluffy `Type`s + coercion flags, NO Verus strings). Non-test consumer: `engine::VerusEngine::discharge`/`evidence_key` (`engine.rs`) consume an `&Obligation`, and `check::obligation_for_item` mints one per checked item on the live L3 path. |
//! | REQ-1.2 (the REGISTRY-TERMINATION class + the full-expression-position closure) | SHIPPED (class assignment + corrected closure) | `ObligationClass::RegistryTermination` is minted for an item whose called-spec-fn set (the corrected `req ∪ ens ∪ body ∪ dec(item)` seed, closure-step over each reached spec-fn's `body ∪ dec` — `check::reachable_spec_fn_names_full`) is non-empty; the Lean-path well-foundedness DISCHARGE is increment (ii), NOT-STARTED. The corrected closure walks the dec measures (was body-only). |
//!
//! The auxiliary OVERFLOW / TERMINATION classes and the multi-class minting of one
//! item's full obligation SET are part of the per-class rendering increment (ii)
//! still grows; increment (i) reifies the class enum (AC-1) + mints the CONTRACT +
//! REGISTRY-TERMINATION classes the §0 pipeline observably discharges today, which
//! is what the Verus engine's `discharge` keys on.
