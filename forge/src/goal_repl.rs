//! `forge/src/goal_repl.rs` — the Lean-style goal-state REPL surface
//! (`fluffy-design.md` §5/§5.1, Appendix B). v1 ships all three increments:
//! `forge goal <file> [item]` and `forge battery <file> [item]` (pure VIEWS over
//! the SHIPPED `check::check_file` cert collection), `forge edit <file> <addr>
//! --replace <code>` (a semantic-address source-text splice over the SHIPPED
//! `fluffy_syntax::address` machinery, then a re-check), and — increment (iii),
//! #193 — `forge fill <file> <hole-addr> <code>`: the `?N` body-hole fill loop.
//! A `?N` hole lexes/parses in `fluffy_syntax` (fn-body statement position only)
//! and is recorded on `FnItem.holes`; a holed item NEVER certifies (`check`
//! short-circuits it to an `OpenHole` L0 cert BEFORE lowering — REQ-5); `forge
//! goal` renders the open holes as the §5.1 `holes:` section; `forge fill` splices
//! `code` at the hole's span (reusing the (ii) splice machinery) and re-checks,
//! surfacing any NEW holes the fill introduced (the §5.1 loop).
//!
//! These verbs add NO verification: `goal`/`battery` are renders over the existing
//! per-item `Vec<Certificate>` (`goal` reads `cert.obligations` + the re-parsed AST
//! contract for given/want; `battery` reads `cert.contract_quality`, which already
//! carries the §7 vacuity + mutation verdicts the gate computed — a VIEW, no
//! accessor needed, AC-1). `edit` resolves the address, splices the replacement at
//! the addressed node's byte span IN THE FILE, re-emits, and re-runs `check_file`.
//!
//! Governing design: `.design/forge/goal-repl.md`.
//!
//! ## REQ status
//!
//! | REQ | Status | Evidence |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | REQ-1 (`forge battery [item]` — battery view) | SHIPPED | `pub fn render_battery` reads each cert's `contract_quality` (tautology / vacuous_precondition / mutants_killed / survivor) — the §7 verdicts the gate ALREADY computed and serialized; a VIEW, no re-derivation, no accessor. Consumer: `cli::run_battery`. Verified: `tests/goal_repl.rs::battery_view_matches_check_verdicts` — the non-vacuous booleans anchored to `conformance/sum.cert.json` (oracle fields), the kill-ratio asserted CROSS-VERB (the ratio is oracle-EXCLUDED — `conformance/README.md`; the golden `17/18` is illustrative, R-CHAR-3). |
//! | REQ-2 (`forge goal <item>` — goal-state render) | SHIPPED | `pub fn render_goal` renders the §5.1 four-part view: `given` (the `req` clause text) / `want` (the `ens` clause texts) / per-obligation status with the failed obligation's concrete witness (`ObligationResult.diagnostic` + `location`, never an adjective — §5.1 property 2); a clean cert renders `ALL GOALS DISCHARGED`. Holes (`?N`) NOT-STARTED (increment iii). Consumer: `cli::run_goal`. Verified: `tests/goal_repl.rs` discharged + counterexample shapes. |
//! | REQ-3 (`forge edit <addr> --replace`) | SHIPPED | `pub fn edit_file` resolves the address via `fluffy_syntax::address::resolve`, finds the addressed `inv`/`dec`/`loop`/`fn` node's byte span by walking the AST (`span_of_address`), splices the replacement SOURCE TEXT at that span, writes the file, re-parses, and re-checks the item. A bad address → `ForgeError::Usage` carrying the structured `AddressError` (never a panic). Consumer: `cli::run_edit`. Verified: `tests/goal_repl.rs` splice round-trip + bad-address. |
//! | REQ-4 (body-position hole `?N` — parser) | SHIPPED | the `?N` lexer token (`TokKind::Hole`) + parser acceptance in fn-body statement position (`fluffy_syntax`, #193) + the `<fn>.?N` address (`AddrKind::Hole`). This module CONSUMES it: `render_goal_item` renders the §5.1 `holes:` section from `holes_of(program, item)` (the `FnItem.holes` the parser recorded); `span_of_address`'s `AddrKind::Hole` arm finds a hole's `?N` span. Verified: `forge/tests/goal_repl_fill.rs` (a `body = ?0` fn → `forge goal` shows the open hole). |
//! | REQ-5 (open-hole validator) | SHIPPED | `forge::check`'s per-item loop short-circuits a holed `FnItem` (any `f.holes`) to a non-certified `Certificate::rejected` with an `OpenHole` cause naming every `<fn>.?N` BEFORE the gate / lowering / verus (the same short-circuit shape the vacuity gate uses) — a holed item NEVER reaches verus, never certifies. `render_goal` surfaces it as the §5.1 open GOAL. Verified: `forge/tests/goal_repl_fill.rs` (a holed item is L0 `OpenHole`, no lowering). |
//! | REQ-6 (`forge fill <addr> <code>`) | SHIPPED | `pub fn fill_hole` — a SPECIALIZATION of `edit_file` whose address names a `?N` hole: it resolves the `<fn>.?N` address (a non-hole address is an honest Usage error directing to `edit`), splices `code` at the hole's `?N` span (reusing the increment-(ii) splice machinery), re-emits, re-parses, re-checks, and renders the new goal state (which may surface NEW holes the fill introduced — the §5.1 loop). Consumer: `cli::run_fill`. Verified: `forge/tests/goal_repl_fill.rs` (fill closes the hole → re-goal shows discharged; fill introducing new holes → re-goal lists them) + the §5.1 dialogue golden (`conformance/goal/binary_search.dialogue.json`, AC-6). |
//! | REQ-7 (determinism + Result discipline) | SHIPPED | every entry (incl. `fill_hole`) returns `Result<_, ForgeError>`; the render is a pure function of the cert collection + AST and the splice a pure function of the span + replacement text (R-CODE-5); a bad address / unresolvable node / non-hole fill target is a structured error, never a panic (R-CODE-2). |
