  CRITIC PIN (cycle 4) — proof-backends.md §4 "the stabilized form": two soundness
  gaps in the #213-revised obligation form, kernel-checked against the shipped spine
  (`lean/Fluffy/Denote.lean`). `stabilizes`/`stabilizesProp` are copied VERBATIM
  from the doc's §4 definition block (they are not yet in the spine — the named
  increment-(ii) prerequisite), so these theorems pin the DOC's form, not a strawman.

  PIN A — the unbound `rbody` (the result-binding hole).
  The §4 exported theorem displays `stabilizesProp ens (Env.bindInt env "result"
  rbody)` with `rbody` bound by NOTHING — no `∀ r, stabilizes body env r →`
  hypothesis; the only prose is "binds via `Env.bindInt` after stabilization" and the
  only computational story in §4 is the fuel₀ exporter HINT. Registry: f(x) = g(x),
  g(x) = 5 (dec-bounded, complete — every §4 gate passes). The item's body `f(x)`
  stabilizes to 5 (`body_stabilizes_to_5`); at the hint fuel 1 it is the BOTTOM 0
  (`rbody_at_hint_fuel_is_bottom`). For the WRONG contract `ens: result == 0` (which
  the real item, result 5, VIOLATES — `wrong_contract_fails_at_true_value`), the §4
  obligation with `rbody` rendered at the hint fuel DISCHARGES
  (`wrong_contract_certifies_with_underfuelled_rbody`): the #213 Int-bottom
  unsoundness RECURS on the body side. The form must quantify the result value
  (`∀ r, stabilizes body env r → …`); the doc does not say so.

  PIN B — the non-dec registry is NOT safely-unprovable; it is bottom-poisoned.
  §4's soundness argument is scoped "for a DEC-MEASURED (terminating) registry", but
  nothing on the Lean path discharges that hypothesis: the parser enforces dec
  PRESENCE only (`SpecFnItem::dec` mandatory); dec VALIDITY (the measure actually
  decreases) is proven ONLY by Verus — and the Lean rung sits exactly downstream of
  a Verus `Unknown` (REQ-3.1 remaps a witness-less failure, e.g. a failed spec-fn
  termination proof, to `Unknown` → degrade → Lean attempts). For the divergent
  registry f(x) = f(x), the fuel denotation is CONSTANTLY the bottom 0
  (`divergent_call_is_const_bottom`), so `stabilizes` HOLDS with the bottom value
  (`divergent_registry_stabilizes_to_bottom`) and the contract `ens: result == f(x)`
  STABILIZES TO TRUE at result = 0 (`divergent_contract_certifies`) — the obligation
  is provable with a bottom-poisoned meaning, not unprovable. The doc neither names
  who guarantees dec-validity reaches the exporter nor assigns registry-termination
  as a mandatory obligation class (REQ-7's TERMINATION covers the item's own
  loop/recursion via `while_rule`, not the registry).

  Tracking: see the cycle-4 crosslink issues referenced in the commit. This file is
  the audit artifact; like PinIntBottom.lean it must keep compiling.
