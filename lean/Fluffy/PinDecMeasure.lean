  CRITIC PIN (cycle 6) — proof-backends.md §4/#224 closure vs §1.2
  REGISTRY-TERMINATION: `dec`-MEASURE-position spec-calls escape the
  `req ∪ ens ∪ body` reachability set, and a measure denoted against the
  closure-populated `R_item` can AFFIRM well-founded descent the SOURCE
  measure does not have — falsely discharging the very class that guards
  Pin B's divergent-registry bottom-poisoning.

  Authority chain:
  - §4 hard gate (#224): "`calledSpecFns(item)` is defined as every spec-fn
    name reachable from `req ∪ ens ∪ body` — TRANSITIVELY: the set is closed
    under 'a reachable spec-fn's OWN body may call further spec-fns'". The
    seed excludes the item's `dec`, and the closure step is over spec-fn
    BODIES only — a spec-fn's own `dec` clause is in NO covered position.
    `R_item` is "exactly calledSpecFns(item)" and the per-name `decide`
    lemmas "range over calledSpecFns" — so a spec-fn called ONLY from a
    `dec` measure is absent from `R_item` and gets NO resolution lemma.
  - §1.2 REQ-1.2 introduces per-spec-fn obligations ABOUT those `dec`
    measures ("EVERY spec-fn in `R_item` carries a per-spec-fn obligation
    that its `dec` measure is VALID"), with the Lean discharge path (b)
    "a `termination_by`/`decreasing_by`-shaped obligation over the encoded
    `R_item`" — and the doc claims categorically (§1.2 closure / §3.1 note)
    that a divergent spec-fn "FAILS this class on BOTH paths" / "cannot
    satisfy" a Lean well-foundedness proof. REQ-1/REQ-1.2 bind the class to
    "the SAME reachability set the §4 hard gate uses" — a set that
    structurally cannot cover the expressions the class is ABOUT.
  - Grammar ground truth: `SpecFnItem.dec : Clause` (`fluffy-syntax/src/
    ast.rs`, `Clause` wraps a full `Expr`) — nothing in fluffy-design.md
    §4.1/§4.2 restricts a `dec` measure to be specCall-free (`dec
    spec_size(t)` is a natural tree measure). The SHIPPED forge closure has
    the same omission: `reachable_spec_fn_deps` / `collect_block_spec_fn_calls`
    (`forge/src/check.rs`) walk `decl.body` only, never `decl.dec`.
  - Spine ground truth (`Denote.lean`): an unresolved `specCall` bottoms in
    `intVal` at EVERY fuel (`| none => 0` at fuel+1, catch-all at fuel 0),
    while `arith`/`var` are fuel-transparent — so a measure containing an
    out-of-closure spec-call denotes a DIFFERENT measure, stably.

  The pin: measure `x - t(x)` with true source registry `t(x) = x`.
  - REAL measure: `x - x = 0` — CONSTANT, never strictly descends: the
    classic non-well-founded measure of a divergent spec-fn.
  - Measure as denoted against the #224-closure `R_item` (t escapes
    `req ∪ ens ∪ body`, so t ∉ R_item): `t(x)` bottoms to 0, the measure
    denotes `x - 0 = x` — which STRICTLY DESCENDS on the recursive call
    `x → x - 1`. A `decreasing_by`-shaped check stated over the encoded
    `R_item` (REQ-1.2(b), the only registry the exported artifact carries)
    AFFIRMS descent; REGISTRY-TERMINATION discharges; the stabilization
    soundness lemma's dec-VALID hypothesis is falsely satisfied; and Pin B's
    `divergent_contract_certifies` (PinStabilization.lean) becomes reachable
    at the certificate level again — one position to the left of #224.

  Fix direction (the generator's, not mine): either extend the closure seed
  and closure step to include `dec` clauses (item's `dec` + each reached
  spec-fn's `dec`), or normatively restrict `dec` measures to specCall-free
  and gate that — the doc currently does neither while claiming the class
  fails "on BOTH paths".

  Tracking: see the crosslink issue cited in the doc-audit report. This file
  is the audit artifact; like PinIntBottom.lean / PinStabilization.lean /
  PinBodyRegistry.lean it must keep compiling.
