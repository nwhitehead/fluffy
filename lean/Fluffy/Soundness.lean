  Fluffy/Soundness.lean — the (T1) soundness theorem for the comparison + logical
  fragment (#170) EXTENDED with the ARITHMETIC operators (#176), the CASTS (#177), the
  SPEC-CONTEXT REWRITES (#178), the 6 BOUNDED-QUANTIFIER COMBINATORS (#179), and the
  MATCH-IN-ENS / `is` PAYLOAD-IN-CONTRACT forms (#180 / 1g — the C7 class); epic #169.

  THE #180 MATCH/`is` EXTENSION. `ref_sound` gains the `optResVar`/`match_`/`is_` cases; the
  `match_` case threads a MUTUAL `ref_sound_arms` (the arm-walk soundness — each arm body via the
  recursive `ref_sound` IH, the selection-by-variant + payload-binding SHARED with the source).
  NON-VACUOUS: the negative `match_arm_swap_breaks_soundness` (a `Some`/`None` body swap DISAGREES
  at `result := Some 7`) and `is_wrong_variant_breaks_soundness` (`is Some` tested as `is None`
  DISAGREES) bite; the positives `match_faithful_is_sound`/`match_result_faithful_is_sound`/
  `is_faithful_is_sound` confirm the faithful encoder is sound. Scoped to Option/Result (the
  built-in `Some/None/Ok/Err` `encode_pattern` admits); general user ADTs are OUT (the encoder
  honestly `Err`s on them) and DELIBERATELY not embedded.

  Governing design: `.design/verified/fluffy-semantics.md` REQ-2 (T1: the
  verified-validator obligation `∀ P, ⟦R(P)⟧ = ⟦P⟧_S`, proved by structural induction)
  + AC-2 (the theorem is NON-VACUOUS: the binop/coercion re-statement is the content)
  + Architecture §"S_C" (the `cast → nat/int` rule: "the paren-drop is a (T1) failure
  (a different parse = a different denotation)"). Field vocabulary
  (formal-methods-sota.md finding #1/#2): the VERIFIED-VALIDATOR soundness step
  (Leroy/CompCert), the kernel-checked core of SEMANTIC PRESERVATION for this fragment.

  T1 (this fragment): `∀ e env, refDenote e env ↔ denote e env`.
  `refDenote` follows the reference ENCODER's operator + cast-target maps
  (`encOp`/`encLog`/`encArith`/`encCast` mirror `ref_encode.rs::binop_str`/
  `cast_target`) and its PARENTHESIZATION (`encode_binary`/`encode_cast` wrap their
  operands/inner); `denote` follows the SOURCE meaning. They are defined
  INDEPENDENTLY (so this is not `rfl`-vacuous) and proved equivalent by induction.

  THE #122/#146 RETIREMENT (cast-paren class). The negative lemma
  `cast_paren_drop_breaks_soundness` shows a faulty encoder that DROPS the cast
  paren — emitting `n - 1 as nat` (which Verus/Rust parse as `n - (1 as nat)`)
  instead of the faithful `(n - 1) as nat` — does NOT satisfy soundness at a
  concrete env. This is the proven retirement of the #122/#146 cast-paren class on
  the CONTRACT side: the faithful `encode_cast` paren is what makes T1 hold.

   a companion lemma threading a `RangeArg`'s bounds. Because `Expr`/`RangeArg` are
   MUTUALLY inductive (the `induction` tactic does not support them), these are proved
   as MUTUAL STRUCTURAL-RECURSIVE theorems (the recursive calls ARE the inductive
   hypotheses; Lean checks the structural decrease). The `@`-view (`seqVar`/`strVar` →
   identity), the `subrange` (→ the same `seqSub`), and the byte-view dispatch
   (`byteView_encByteAt`/`byteView_encLen`) are PROVEN denotation-preserving here; the

  **(T1) — verified-validator soundness, comparison/logical/arithmetic/cast/
  spec-context-rewrite fragment.**

  For every contract `Expr` `e` in the fragment and every environment `env`, the
  meaning of the reference encoder's output (`refDenote`, routed through the encoder's
  operator + cast-target maps, its parenthesization, the slice→`@`/`subrange` rewrite,
  and the byte-view dispatch) is LOGICALLY EQUIVALENT to the source denotation
  (`denote`, the standard `S_C` meaning). Proved by structural `induction` on `e`, one
  case per inference rule (`fluffy-semantics.md` REQ-2).

  NON-VACUOUS: `refDenote`/`refIntVal`/`refSeqVal` and `denote`/`intVal`/`seqVal` are
  defined in separate modules following different structure (the encoder's binop/cast
  maps + paren + `@`-view + byte-view dispatch vs the source relation/arithmetic/
  element/byte); the `cmp` case discharges the `encOp`/`tokRel` round-trip per operator
  AND the integer-operand equality `refIntVal_eq_intVal` — which itself carries the #176
  arithmetic round-trip, the #177 cast round-trip, and the #178 `@`-view/`subrange`/
  byte-view rewrites (via `refVal_eq`), NOT a definitional collapse. See
  `eq_le_infidelity_*` (the `==`-vs-`<=` teeth), `cast_paren_drop_breaks_soundness` (the
  #122/#146 cast-paren teeth), and `byteview_misdispatch_breaks_soundness` (the #127
  byte-view-dispatch teeth) below.

  The dispatch's explicit requirement: demonstrate that an encoder that DROPS the
  cast paren — emitting `(n - 1) as nat` as the bare `n - 1 as nat`, which Verus/Rust
  PARSE as `n - (1 as nat)` (a cast binds tighter than `-`) — does NOT satisfy
  soundness at a concrete env where the precedence changes the value. This is the
  #122 `divergence_cast_paren` / #146 cast-mis-parse bug, now PROVEN to break T1 on
  the contract side: the faithful `encode_cast` paren (`refIntVal`'s `cast` arm casts
  the WHOLE inner) is exactly what makes `ref_sound` hold for casts.

  The source clause: `(n - 1) as nat`, i.e.
    `Expr.cast (Expr.arith ArithOp.sub (Expr.var "n") (Expr.intLit 1)) CastTy.nat`.
  Its FAITHFUL denotation casts the whole subtraction: `((n - 1) : Int).toNat`.
  The PAREN-DROPPED encoder instead binds the cast to only the rightmost atom `1`,
  yielding `n - (1 as nat)` = `n - (1 : Int)` (no cast on `n`, the `-` outside the
  cast). At `n = -1` these differ: faithful `(-1 - 1).toNat = (-2).toNat = 0`;
  paren-dropped `-1 - 1 = -2`. `0 ≠ -2`. -/

    AST and take its faithful `refIntVal` (the bug is the ENCODER's missing paren, not

  The dispatch's explicit requirement (the #178 point): demonstrate that an encoder
  that MIS-DISPATCHES the byte-view — the #127 name-collision bug, where the encoder
  picks the WRONG byte-view spec fn — does NOT satisfy soundness at a concrete sequence
  env. Two faulty dispatches, both real instances of the #127 class:

    (A) WRONG INDEX. The faithful `s.byte_at(0)` → `s.spec_byte_at(0)` reads byte 0.
        A buggy encoder emitting `s.spec_byte_at(0 + 1)` (an off-by-one index) reads
        byte 1. At `s := [10, 20, 30]` these are `10` vs `20` — they DISAGREE.
    (B) WRONG RECEIVER-METHOD. The faithful `s.byte_at(i)` dispatches to the i-th-byte
        spec fn (`encByteAt = specByteAt`). A buggy encoder that mis-dispatched
        `byte_at` to the LENGTH spec fn (`specLen` — the #127 name collision: picking
        `spec_len` for a `byte_at` call) reads the length `3` instead of byte 0 (`10`).
        `10 ≠ 3` — they DISAGREE.

  This is the #127 (`divergence_byteview_name_collision`) class, now PROVEN to break
  T1 on the contract side: the faithful `encByteAt`/`encLen` dispatch (`refIntVal`'s
  `idx`/`byteAt`/`seqLen` arms, the `byteView_encByteAt`/`byteView_encLen` round-trips)

  The dispatch's explicit requirement (a): demonstrate that an encoder that emitted the
  WRONG combinator — `forall_in` (a bounded `∀`) lowered as `exists_in` (a bounded `∃`)
  — does NOT satisfy soundness at a concrete sequence. The two quantifier forms differ
  (`∀ i, .. → p(s[i])` vs `∃ i, .. ∧ p(s[i])`) precisely when SOME element satisfies the
  predicate and some does not. This is the combinator analogue of the `==`-vs-`<=` teeth:
  the encoder's choice of WHICH frozen `verus_l3` quantifier (`encode_call`'s
  `lookup(name)` dispatch — referencing the RIGHT combinator) is load-bearing.

  Source clause: `forall_in(s, |x| x ≤ 15)`, i.e.
    `Expr.comb forallIn (strVar "s") none none (some (Pred.mk "x" (x ≤ 15)))`.
  At `envAB` (`s := [10, 20, 30]`) the source `∀ i, 0≤i<3 → s[i] ≤ 15` is FALSE (`20 > 15`),
  while the WRONG `exists_in` form `∃ i, 0≤i<3 ∧ s[i] ≤ 15` is TRUE (`10 ≤ 15`). FALSE vs

/-! ## Negative sanity lemma 5 — the #145 ARG-KIND teeth (the retired class)

  The dispatch's explicit requirement (b): demonstrate the #145 (`divergence_index_
  combinator`) bug — `forall_below`/`forall_from`'s `ArgKind::Index` bound `n` (a SCALAR
  `int`) ENCODED AS A SLICE `@`-view instead of a scalar. `encode_combinator_arg`'s `#145`
  fix dispatches `ArgKind::Index → encode_index_value` (the scalar `<n> as int`), NOT
  `encode_slice_arg` (the `@`-view). A buggy encoder that slice-`@`-viewed the index would
  produce `n@` (a Verus type error in production; on the contract side, a DIFFERENT
  quantifier bound — the LENGTH of `n`'s view rather than the scalar `n`).

  Source clause: `forall_below(s, n, |x| x ≤ 15)` with the index `n` a SCALAR. We model the
  #145 bug as the SAME `forall_below` form but with the quantifier bound taken from the
  SLICE-`@`-VIEW length of the index arg (`(refSeqVal n).length`) instead of the scalar
  `intVal n`. At an env where the scalar `n` (= 1) differs from the slice-view length
  (`n@` bound to `[10,20,30]`, length 3) and `s := [10,20,30]` with `|x| x ≤ 15`:
    - faithful bound `n = 1`: `∀ i, 0≤i<1 ∧ i<3 → s[i] ≤ 15` — only `i=0` (`10 ≤ 15`) → TRUE.
    - #145-buggy bound `= 3`: `∀ i, 0≤i<3 ∧ i<3 → s[i] ≤ 15` — `i=1` (`20 ≤ 15`) → FALSE.
  TRUE vs FALSE — they DISAGREE, so slice-`@`-viewing the Index arg breaks T1. This is the
  proven retirement of the #145 arg-kind class on the contract side: `encode_combinator_arg`
  threading `ArgKind::Index` as a SCALAR (not a `@`-view) is exactly what `ref_sound`'s
  `comb` case pins (its `forallBelow` arm uses `refIntVal_eq_intVal` on the SCALAR index). -/

/-- A concrete env for the #145 teeth: the index var `n` is the SCALAR `1`, while `n`'s
    SLICE `@`-view (the buggy reading) is `[10, 20, 30]` (length `3`); `s := [10, 20, 30]`.

  match-in-ens analogue of the `==`-vs-`<=` / wrong-combinator teeth: which arm body goes under
  which pattern (`encode_match` pairing `encode_pattern(arm.pattern)` with `encode(arm.body)`) is
  load-bearing.
