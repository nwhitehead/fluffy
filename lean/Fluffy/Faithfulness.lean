  Fluffy/Faithfulness.lean — the (T2) TRANSLATION-VALIDATION META-THEOREM capstone
  (increments (d) #174 + 3b #183; epic #169). THE EXISTENTIAL → UNIVERSAL CONVERSION.

  This module is the CompCert-class keystone of the lowering-soundness arc: it COMPOSES
  the three already-proven (T1) validator-soundness theorems with the per-run
  translation-validation (TV) result and discharges the (T2) UNIVERSAL semantic-
  preservation guarantee — `∀ P passing TV, ⟦lower(P)⟧ = ⟦P⟧_S` — RELATIVE to the named
  trust base `{Z3 soundness, S = the intended meaning, the Lean kernel}`. It is the
  verified-validator architecture's conclusion (Leroy/CompCert, finding #1: a verified
  validator ∘ an unverified compiler = a verified-compiler-strength guarantee).

  Governing design: `.design/verified/fluffy-semantics.md`
    - REQ-3 (T2 — SEMANTIC PRESERVATION, stated as a FORWARD SIMULATION; the relation
      `∼`, observable = the caged contract fragment + the `fx` rows; finding #2),
    - REQ-7 (the VERIFIED-VALIDATOR architecture — Leroy finding #1 / Necula finding #4:
      `R` + the per-run Z3 check IS the validator; (T1) is what makes it *verified*),
    - the SOUNDNESS THEOREM section "(T2) — semantic preservation": the one-line
      modus-ponens proof `⟦lower(P)⟧ = ⟦R(P)⟧ = ⟦P⟧_S` and its `{Z3, S}` relativity,
    - AC-3 (the composition is `h_tv.trans (T1)`), AC-4 (the relativity + the reduced-
      trusted-base enumeration, Leroy finding #3).

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  THE TRUST BOUNDARY — `h_tv` IS Z3-DISCHARGED, **NOT** LEAN-PROVEN.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  The per-run TV does: for the program `P` under check, Z3 proves
  `lower(P) ⟺ ref(P)` (the production-emitted Verus predicate is logically equivalent
  to the SMALL reference encoder's output). By Verus's logic soundness, that Z3 result
  MEANS `⟦lower(P)⟧ = ⟦ref(P)⟧` (denotational equality of the two Verus forms). In this
  module that per-run Z3 attestation is modelled as the EXPLICIT HYPOTHESIS

      `h_tv : ⟦lower(P)⟧ = ⟦ref(P)⟧`   (the contract layer's `↔` form, or the `=` form).

  This is the TRUST BOUNDARY. `h_tv` is the EXTERNAL ORACLE's premise — Z3 discharges it
  per run. Lean does NOT prove `h_tv`; the capstone theorems take it as a hypothesis and
  COMPOSE it with the kernel-proven (T1). Increment 4a (#184) is the route to DEMOTE Z3:
  reconstruct the Z3/cvc5 proof into a kernel-checked Lean proof (Lean-SMT, finding #8) —
  until then `h_tv` is the Z3-TRUSTED premise, and (T2) is RELATIVE to Z3 soundness.

  To make `h_tv` a GENUINE premise (NOT `True`, NOT trivially satisfiable), `⟦lower(P)⟧`
  is modelled as an ARBITRARY value `lowered` of the denotation type (a universally-
  quantified parameter standing for the Z3-attested meaning of WHATEVER the unverified
  production lowerer emitted). For an arbitrary `lowered`, `h_tv` is FALSE unless Z3 in
  fact attested it — so the theorem genuinely CONSUMES the TV result; it does not invent
  faithfulness for a `lowered` that disagrees with the reference. The `∀ P` (and
  `∀ lowered`) quantification is therefore REAL: the conclusion is the faithfulness
  EQUALITY for EVERY program, with the ONLY per-`P` input being the Z3-supplied `h_tv`.
  THAT is the existential → universal conversion (not "there exists a faithful `P`" but
  "every `P` passing TV is faithful").

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  THE (T1) THEOREMS COMPOSED (all SHIPPED + critic-clean; this module does NOT touch them).
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    - `Fluffy.ref_sound_eq` (S_C, `Fluffy/Soundness.lean`):
        `refDenote fuel e env = denote fuel e env` — the reference CONTRACT encoder is
        denotation-faithful over ALL 8 contract construct classes.
    - `Fluffy.Exec.exec_ref_sound` (S_E, `Fluffy/Exec.lean`):
        `execRefValue e env = execDenote e env` — the EXEC-EXPRESSION encoder is faithful
        (bounded value, overflow-as-obligation, never nat-coerced).
    - `Fluffy.Exec.body_ref_sound` (S_B, `Fluffy/Exec/Stmt.lean`):
        `bodyRefState b st = bodyDenote b st` — the straight-line exec-BODY encoder is
        faithful (loops #163 are OUT, kernel-gated).

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  THE FULL TRUST BASE + THE NAMED RESIDUALS (enumerated below the theorems, REQ-3 AC-4;
  reduced-trusted-base framing, Leroy finding #3). `#print axioms lowering_faithful`
  shows the LEAN-side trust (propext/Quot.sound/Classical.choice — standard); the trusted
  COMPONENTS (Z3, S = intended meaning, Verus VC-gen, rustc/LLVM) + the residuals
  (loops #163, Z3-demotion #184, the Rust↔Lean correspondence #185) are documented, never
  hidden, never machine-closed.

/-! ## The TV-hypothesis abstraction (`h_tv`) — the Z3-discharged premise per layer

  `TvHyp` records, per encoder layer, that the per-run Z3 check attested
  `⟦lower(P)⟧ = ⟦ref(P)⟧`. The left side `lowered` is the Z3-attested meaning of the
  PRODUCTION lowerer's output (modelled as an arbitrary denotation value — the unverified
  lowerer is a black box; only its Z3-checked MEANING enters here). The right side is the
  reference encoder's meaning under `S`. The field IS the trust boundary: it is supplied
  by Z3, never proved in Lean. (#184 demotes the supplier to a kernel-checked proof.) -/

/-- A whole-FUNCTION TV witness: the per-run Z3 attestations for a function = a CONTRACT
    clause (`S_C`) + an exec BODY (`S_B`, which itself composes `S_E`). Both fields are
    Z3-discharged premises; bundling them is the whole-program composition (`lowering_faithful`
    consumes a `FnTvWitness`). NON-VACUOUS: each field is a genuine equality the production
    lowering must satisfy, attested per run — it is not `True`. -/
structure FnTvWitness where

      fuel-uniform, so any fuel works). -/

/-! ## The per-layer (T2) meta-theorems — `h_tv ∧ T1 ⟹ ⟦lower(P)⟧ = ⟦P⟧_S`

  Each is the one-line modus-ponens (AC-3): `h_tv.trans (T1 P)`. The STATEMENT is the
  deliverable — the universal `∀ P` faithfulness relative to `{Z3, S}`. The proof is
  short BECAUSE (T1) is already kernel-checked; the content is the COMPOSITION direction:
  the Z3-attested `lowered` equals the SOURCE meaning under `S`, given only the per-run
  `h_tv`. -/

/--
  **(T2) — the CONTRACT-layer translation-validation meta-theorem (`S_C`).**

  For EVERY contract clause `e` (and every `fuel`/`env`), and for EVERY `lowered : Prop`
  standing for the Z3-attested meaning of the production lowering of `e`: IF the per-run
  TV attested `lowered = ⟦ref(e)⟧` (`h_tv`, the Z3-discharged premise), THEN the lowering
  is FAITHFUL to the source meaning under `S_C`: `lowered = ⟦e⟧_{S_C}`.

  Proof: `h_tv.trans (ref_sound_eq …)` — the per-run TV `⟦lower⟧ = ⟦ref⟧` composed with
  the kernel-proven (T1) `⟦ref⟧ = ⟦e⟧_S`. The `∀ e` (and `∀ lowered`) is REAL; `h_tv` is
  the GENUINE Z3-discharged premise (for an arbitrary `lowered` it is FALSE unless Z3
  attested it — the conclusion is not a tautology). This is the contract-side existential
  → universal conversion: every contract clause passing TV is faithfully lowered, relative
  to `{Z3, S_C}`. -/
theorem tv_meta_contract
    (fuel : Nat) (e : Expr) (env : Env) (lowered : Prop)
    (h_tv : lowered = refDenote fuel e env) :
    lowered = denote fuel e env :=
  h_tv.trans (ref_sound_eq fuel e env)

/--
  **(T2) — the EXEC-EXPRESSION-layer translation-validation meta-theorem (`S_E`).**

  For EVERY pure exec expression `e` (and every `env`), and for EVERY
  `lowered : Option ExecVal` standing for the Z3-attested meaning of the production
  lowering of `e`: IF the per-run TV attested `lowered = ⟦ref(e)⟧` (`h_tv`), THEN the
  lowering is FAITHFUL to the source bounded-value meaning under `S_E`: `lowered = ⟦e⟧_{S_E}`.

  Proof: `h_tv.trans (exec_ref_sound …)`. The BOUNDED / overflow-as-obligation / never-
  nat-coerced content of `S_E` is carried THROUGH `exec_ref_sound` (the kernel-proven T1);
  here it is composed with the per-run TV. `h_tv` is the genuine Z3-discharged premise. -/
theorem tv_meta_exec
    (e : Fluffy.Exec.ExecExpr) (env : Fluffy.Exec.ExecEnv)
    (lowered : Option Fluffy.Exec.ExecVal)
    (h_tv : lowered = Fluffy.Exec.execRefValue e env) :
    lowered = Fluffy.Exec.execDenote e env :=
  h_tv.trans (Fluffy.Exec.exec_ref_sound e env)

/--
  **(T2) — the EXEC-BODY-layer translation-validation meta-theorem (`S_B`, straight-line).**

  For EVERY straight-line exec body `b` (and every state `st`), and for EVERY
  `lowered : Option ExecVal` standing for the Z3-attested meaning of the production
  lowering of `b`: IF the per-run TV attested `lowered = ⟦ref(b)⟧` (`h_tv`), THEN the
  lowering is FAITHFUL to the source state-transformer meaning under `S_B`:
  `lowered = ⟦b⟧_{S_B}`.

  Proof: `h_tv.trans (body_ref_sound …)`. The big-step state-transformer content (the
  threading / scalar-mutation rebind / branch composition / tail projection, with the
  obligation-`none` propagating) is carried through `body_ref_sound` (the kernel-proven
  T1). LOOPS are OUT (#163, kernel-gated) — `b` ranges over the straight-line `Block`
  fragment exactly as `body_ref_sound` does. `h_tv` is the genuine Z3-discharged premise. -/
theorem tv_meta_body
    (b : Fluffy.Exec.Block) (st : Fluffy.Exec.State)
    (lowered : Option Fluffy.Exec.ExecVal)

    lowered = Fluffy.Exec.bodyDenote b st :=
  h_tv.trans (Fluffy.Exec.body_ref_sound b st)

/-! ## The COMPOSED whole-program (T2) meta-theorem — `lowering_faithful`

  A Fluffy function = a CONTRACT (`S_C`) + a straight-line BODY (`S_B`/`S_E`). Given the
  per-encoder TV witnesses (the Z3-discharged `h_tv` for each layer, bundled in a
  `FnTvWitness`) and the composed (T1), the WHOLE lowering of the function is faithful: its
  lowered contract MEANS its source contract under `S_C`, AND its lowered body MEANS its
  source body under `S_B`. This is the verified-validator architecture's conclusion for the
  whole straight-line frozen subset. -/

/--
  **(T2) — `lowering_faithful`: the COMPOSED whole-program semantic-preservation capstone.**

  For EVERY Fluffy function (a contract clause + a straight-line exec body) and EVERY
  per-run TV witness `w` (the bundled Z3-discharged `h_tv` for the contract layer AND the
  body layer): the WHOLE lowering is FAITHFUL to the source meaning under `S = S_C ⊔ S_B`:

      `w.loweredContract = ⟦w.contract⟧_{S_C}`   ∧   `w.loweredBody = ⟦w.body⟧_{S_B}`.

  i.e. `S ≈ C` for this function — the FORWARD-SIMULATION relation `∼` holds between the
  Fluffy state and the emitted Verus-Rust target state, preserving the OBSERVABLE effects
  (the caged contract fragment + the `fx` rows; finding #2). The denotational equality this
  theorem establishes IS the relation `∼`.

  Proof: the conjunction of `tv_meta_contract` (the contract layer) and `tv_meta_body` (the
  body layer), each the `h_tv.trans (T1)` composition. The `∀ w` quantification is REAL: the
  theorem holds for ANY function, with the only per-function input being the Z3-supplied
  TV witness `w`. THIS is the existential → universal conversion — NOT "there exists a
  faithfully-lowered function" but "EVERY function passing TV is faithfully lowered",
  RELATIVE to `{Z3 soundness, S = the intended meaning, the Lean kernel}`. -/
theorem lowering_faithful (w : FnTvWitness) :
    w.loweredContract = denote w.fuel w.contract w.contractEnv
    ∧ w.loweredBody = Fluffy.Exec.bodyDenote w.body w.bodyState :=
  ⟨tv_meta_contract w.fuel w.contract w.contractEnv w.loweredContract w.h_tv_contract,
   tv_meta_body w.body w.bodyState w.loweredBody w.h_tv_body⟩

/-! ## NON-VACUITY of the capstone — `h_tv` is a GENUINE premise, the `∀` is REAL

  These witnesses PROVE that `lowering_faithful` (and its per-layer pieces) is not a
  trivial tautology: the conclusion is the faithfulness EQUALITY, and `h_tv` is a real
  premise that the conclusion CONSUMES (a `lowered` that DISAGREES with the reference does
  NOT get certified — the theorem refuses, exactly because `h_tv` would be false). -/

/-- `h_tv` is NOT trivially satisfiable: there is a `lowered` (here `False`) and a contract
    clause whose Z3-attestation `h_tv` is FALSE — so `tv_meta_contract` cannot be invoked
    for it. This pins `h_tv` as a GENUINE premise (a vacuous/`True` premise would always
    hold). The witness clause `a == b` at `envAB` (`a:=1, b:=2`) has source meaning FALSE
    `1 = 2`; the encoder meaning is likewise `refDenote … = (1 = 2)`. Taking the BOGUS
    `lowered := (2 = 2)` (TRUE — a hypothetical lowerer that emitted a faithful-LOOKING but
    semantically-WRONG predicate), `h_tv : (2 = 2) = (refDenote …)` is FALSE: a TRUE `Prop`
    is not equal to the FALSE encoder meaning. So no `h_tv` is available — the theorem does
    not fire, demonstrating it genuinely DEPENDS on the Z3 attestation. -/
theorem h_tv_is_genuine_premise :
    ¬ ((2 = 2) = refDenote 0 (Expr.cmp CmpOp.eq (Expr.var "a") (Expr.var "b")) envAB) := by
  -- refDenote of `a == b` at envAB is the FALSE proposition `1 = 2`; `(2 = 2)` is TRUE.
  -- A TRUE Prop equals a FALSE Prop is itself absurd.
  intro h
  have hRef : ¬ refDenote 0 (Expr.cmp CmpOp.eq (Expr.var "a") (Expr.var "b")) envAB := by
    simp [refDenote, encOp, tokRel, refIntVal, envAB]
  rw [← h] at hRef
  exact hRef rfl

/-- The faithful POSITIVE direction (non-vacuity, the other side): when the production
    lowering IS faithful — i.e. Z3 genuinely attested `lowered = ⟦ref(e)⟧` — the meta-theorem
    CONCLUDES faithfulness to `S`. Here a lowerer whose meaning IS the reference meaning of
    `a == b` (`lowered := refDenote …`) trivially satisfies `h_tv` (by `rfl`), and
    `tv_meta_contract` then derives `lowered = ⟦a == b⟧_{S_C}` (the source `1 = 2`). This
    confirms the theorem FIRES on a genuine TV pass — it is not vacuously unusable. -/
