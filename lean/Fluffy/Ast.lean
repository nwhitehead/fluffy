  Fluffy/Ast.lean — the contract-sublanguage AST as a Lean `inductive`, for the
  COMPARISON + LOGICAL fragment (increment (a), #170) EXTENDED with the ARITHMETIC
  operators (increment (b), #176), the CASTS (increment (c), #177), and the
  SPEC-CONTEXT REWRITES (increment (f), #178 — slice→`@`/subrange, indexing, and the
  method→`spec_*` byte-view DISPATCH, the #127 class); epic #169.

  Governing design: `.design/verified/fluffy-semantics.md` REQ-1/REQ-6 (the
  `S_C` denotation domain; the Lean module layout) + AC-1 (S is stated over the
  exact frozen subset the encoders admit) + Architecture §"S_C" (the binop map +
  the `cast → nat/int` coercion rule, "the #122 class is a property of the
  production STRING ... the (T1) obligation is precisely 'does the production
  string PARSE to an AST whose denotation matches'").

  This mirrors the relevant `fluffy-syntax/src/ast.rs` `Expr` / `BinOp` /
  `Type` / `PrimType` variants for THIS fragment:
    - integer literals          (`Expr::IntLit { value, .. }`)
    - bool literals             (`Expr::BoolLit(b)`)
    - variables / `result` / `old(x)`  (`Expr::Path` + the `old(_)` call form —
      all denote as free names of type `Int`, per `S_C`'s "literals/refs denote
      themselves" rule; the obligation binds each as a distinct param)
    - comparison binops         (`BinOp::{Eq,Ne,Lt,Le,Gt,Ge}`)
    - logical binops + negation (`BinOp::{And,Or}`, `UnaryOp::Not`)
    - ARITHMETIC binops (#176)   (`BinOp::{Add,Sub,Mul,Div,Rem,Shl,Shr,BitAnd,
                                  BitOr,BitXor}` — integer/`int` arithmetic over
                                  the values; NO wraparound — overflow is an
                                  EXEC-side obligation, increment #171, not here)
    - CASTS (#177)               (`Expr::Cast { expr, ty }` to
                                  `u64`/`u32`/`usize`/`nat`/`int` — value coercions)

  PARTIALITY (#176): `Div`/`Rem`/`Shl`/`Shr` are PARTIAL in the source — a zero
  divisor / a zero shift is rejected as a precondition (an L0 obligation discharged
  OUTSIDE the contract clause, `ast.rs` `BinOp::Rem` "PARTIAL: requires a nonzero
  divisor"). The denotation models them with Lean's TOTAL `Int` operations under
  the divisor-≠0 convention; because `denote` and `refDenote` use the SAME total
  operation, T1 holds regardless of the guard (the guard is the source-side
  precondition, not part of the binop's meaning when the precondition holds —
  Euclidean-consistent, see `Denote.lean`).

  THE SPEC-CONTEXT REWRITES (#178). In contract position a slice/`String` param does
  NOT denote a scalar — it denotes a SEQUENCE, and the encoder REWRITES the use sites:
    - a slice param `xs`            → `xs@` (the `Seq` view; the identity on the value)
    - `xs[i]`                       → `xs@[i]` (the i-th element)
    - `&xs[..i]` / `&xs[a..b]`      → `xs@.subrange(0, i as int)` / `xs@.subrange(a, b)`
    - a `String` receiver `s.byte_at(i)` → `s.spec_byte_at(i)` (the byte-view DISPATCH)
    - `s.len()`                     → `s.spec_len()`             (the byte-view DISPATCH)
  The THEOREM (`ref_sound`): these rewrites PRESERVE MEANING (`@`/subrange/`spec_*` is
  the identity-on-meaning coercion from the exec slice/`String` to its spec sequence).
  The #127 NEGATIVE lemma shows a WRONG dispatch (wrong index / wrong receiver-method)
  FAILS soundness. To model this `Ast.lean` gains:
    - `SeqVar`             — a free SEQUENCE name (a `&[u32]` slice / a `String`'s bytes)
    - `Expr.idx`           — `xs[i]` over a sequence var at an integer index
    - `RangeArg` + `Expr.subrange` — the `&xs[..i]`/`&xs[a..b]`/`&xs[a..]` range borrow
    - `Expr.seqLen`        — `xs.len()` / `s.len()` (the sequence length, → `spec_len`)
    - `Expr.byteAt`        — `s.byte_at(i)` (the i-th byte, → `spec_byte_at`)
  These are integer-valued (an element / a byte / a length) except `subrange`, which is
  sequence-valued and feeds another `idx`/`seqLen`/`byteAt` (so the prefix's meaning is
  observed through a later element/length read — exactly how a contract clause uses it).

  THE 6 BOUNDED-QUANTIFIER COMBINATORS (#179, increment 1d-i). In contract position a
  combinator CALL `Call(C, args)` denotes its FROZEN `verus_l3` quantifier form
  (`fluffy-spec/src/combinators.rs`), with each argument threaded PER ITS REGISTRY
  ARG-KIND (`CombinatorSig.arg_kinds`/`ArgKind`):
    - `forall_in(s, p)`    = `∀ i, 0 ≤ i < s.len() → p(s[i])`
    - `exists_in(s, p)`    = `∃ i, 0 ≤ i < s.len() ∧ p(s[i])`
    - `sorted(s)`          = `∀ i j, 0 ≤ i ≤ j < s.len() → s[i] ≤ s[j]`
    - `forall_below(s,n,p)`= `∀ i, 0 ≤ i < n ∧ i < s.len() → p(s[i])`
    - `forall_from(s,n,p)` = `∀ i, n ≤ i < s.len() → p(s[i])`
    - `disjoint(a, b)`     = `∀ i j, (0 ≤ i < a.len() ∧ 0 ≤ j < b.len()) → a[i] ≠ b[j]`
  To embed these `Ast.lean` gains:
    - `CombName`           — the 6 frozen names (the closed combinator set, sans the 2
      RECURSIVE combinators `count_where`/`permutation_of`, which are #182 / 1d-ii and
      DELIBERATELY ABSENT — no embed-then-`sorry`).
    - `Pred`               — a FLAT predicate closure `|x| <body>` (`ArgKind::Pred`): a
      bound element-var name + a body `Expr` over the comparison/logical/arithmetic
      fragment (§4.2 "no anonymous nested quantifiers" — so the body REUSES the existing
      `Expr`). `p(s[i])` denotes as the body with the bound var ↦ the i-th element.
    - `Expr.comb`          — a combinator call carrying: the name `c`; a primary slice
      `seq` (`ArgKind::Slice` → the `@`-view, #178/1f); an OPTIONAL second slice `seq2`
      (only `disjoint`); an OPTIONAL scalar index `idx` (only `forall_below`/`forall_from`
      — `ArgKind::Index`, a SCALAR `int`, NOT a slice `@`-view: THE #145 BUG CLASS); and
      an OPTIONAL predicate `pred` (`ArgKind::Pred`). Each combinator populates exactly
      the fields its `arg_kinds` declares (the others `none`).

  THE MATCH-IN-ENS / `is` PAYLOAD-IN-CONTRACT FORMS (#180, increment 1g — the C7
  payload-in-contract class, `.design/basis/09-option-result.md`). In contract position a
  built-in `Option`/`Result` value (a param / `result`) may be PROJECTED by a spec-`match`
  or TESTED by `is`:
    - `match e { Some(v) => P(v), None => Q }`  (the Option form), and
      `match e { Ok(v) => P(v), Err(err) => Q(err) }`  (the Result form): the arm SELECTED
      by `e`'s variant, with the payload BOUND in the arm predicate. Mirrors `ast.rs`
      `Expr::Match`/`MatchArm`/`Pattern` + `ref_encode.rs`'s `encode_match`/`encode_pattern`
      (the #150 work): the scrutinee + each arm body encode by the SAME recursion, the
      pattern is `encode_pattern`'s built-in `Some(x)`/`None`/`Ok(x)`/`Err(e)` form.
    - `e is Some` / `e is None` / `e is Ok` / `e is Err`: the variant DISCRIMINANT test
      (`ast.rs` `Expr::Is`; `ref_encode.rs`'s `Expr::Is` arm `({s} is {variant})`). `Prop`-
      sorted, true iff `e`'s value is that variant.
  To embed these `Ast.lean` gains:
    - `OptResVar`            — a free `Option`/`Result`-valued name (the scrutinee of a
      `match`/`is`; a param or `result`). Its VALUE (`none`/`some v`/`ok v`/`err e`) lives in
      the env (`Denote.lean` `Env.optres`); the payload `v`/`e` is an `Int` (the C7 corpus
      payloads are integer-valued — `i`/`v`/`err`; faithful to the corpus, NOT general ADTs).
    - `Variant`              — the 4 built-in variants `Some`/`None`/`Ok`/`Err`
      (`encode_pattern`'s `is_builtin_variant` set; a USER enum variant is DELIBERATELY
      ABSENT — `encode_pattern` honestly `Err`s on it, so it is OUT of `S_C` and not embedded).
    - `MatchArm`             — a variant PATTERN (the matched `Variant` + an optional payload
      binder name, `Pattern::Enum`'s `fields[0]` binding / `Pattern::Binding`) + an arm-body
      `Expr` (the flat arm predicate). The C7 `match` arms are FLAT predicates over the bound
      payload (§4.2 cage), so the body REUSES the existing `Expr`. (Guards / wildcard arms are
      out of the C7 fragment — the corpus matches are exhaustive 2-arm `Some/None`/`Ok/Err`.)
    - `Expr.match_`          — a contract-position `match scrut arms`: the scrutinee `Expr`
      (an `optResVar`) + the arms. `Prop`-sorted (a `match`-in-`ens` is a predicate; each arm
      body is a flat `bool`).
    - `Expr.is_`             — a variant test `scrut is variant`: the scrutinee `Expr` + the
      tested `Variant`. `Prop`-sorted.

  GENERAL USER ADTs are NOT covered (scoped to Option/Result, honestly): `encode_pattern`
  itself only admits the built-in `Some/None/Ok/Err` (its `is_builtin_variant` gate `Err`s on a
  user variant, lacking the enum-qualification map), so user ADTs are OUT of what the encoder
  produces — they are not in `S_C` for this increment and are deliberately NOT embedded (no
  embed-then-`sorry`). A general-ADT match (with the variant→discriminant + payload model) is a
  future increment if/when the encoder admits user variants.

  NAMED SPEC-FN CALLS (#181, increment 1e — THE WELL-FOUNDED RECURSIVE FRAGMENT). A user
  `spec fn foo(p0, p1, …) -> R { <body> } dec <measure>` (`fluffy-syntax::ast::SpecFnItem`:
  `params`/`ret`/`dec`/`body`) referenced in a contract is an `Expr::Call` whose callee path is
  NOT a frozen combinator and NOT `old` (`ref_encode.rs::encode_call` case (3)). The encoder emits
  `name(<encoded args>)` — it does NOT inline the body; the body is lowered ONCE as its own Verus
  `spec fn` (the registry entry), and the call site is a CALL to that fn. To embed this `Ast.lean`
  gains:
    - `Expr.specCall (name : String) (args : List Expr)` — the call form, mirroring
      `Expr::Call { callee := Path [name], args }` for a NON-combinator/NON-`old` callee
      (`encode_call`'s case (3)). The args are `Expr`s of the SAME fragment (re-encoded by
      `encode_call_arg`). MUTUAL with `Expr` (the args are a `List Expr`). INTEGER- or
      BOOLEAN/`Prop`-sorted per the spec fn's return type (the corpus spec fns return `nat`/`int`
      or `bool`; the denotation reads the integer or boolean meaning of the resolved body).
    - `SpecFn` (a `structure`) — a spec fn's signature/body: `params : List String` (the param
      NAMES, bound to the denoted args), `body : Expr` (the body over the SAME fragment, MAY contain
      further `specCall`s — recursion). Mirrors `SpecFnItem.params`/`body`. (The `dec` measure
      lives in the TERMINATION argument of the denotation, not in this datum — see `Denote.lean`'s
      fuel-indexed well-founded denotation: the spec fn is total/terminating by §4.2's mandatory
      `dec`, modelled as "the denotation holds for ALL fuel"; the encoder + source share the same
      fuel, so T1 is fuel-uniform — NOT a fuel-cap vacuity dodge.)
    - `Registry` — `String → Option SpecFn`, the spec-fn registry SHARED between `denote` and
      `refDenote` (the body's meaning is the same; it is lowered ONCE + sound by the fragment — the
      registry is the external ground truth, like the combinator registry `lookup`). Carried in the
      `Env` (`Denote.lean` `Env.specs`).

  THE 2 RECURSIVE / AGGREGATE COMBINATORS (#182, increment 1d-ii — the LAST contract brick,
  COMPLETING the closed 8-combinator set 8/8). `count_where` (a recursive `nat` COUNT) and
  `permutation_of` (MULTISET equality) are now EMBEDDED (`CombName.countWhere`/`permutationOf`,
  reusing the `Expr.comb` constructor). `count_where` is a VALUE-combinator — it threads
  `intVal`/`refIntVal` (read at its integer count), faithful to the recursive `verus_l3`
  (`Denote.lean` `countWhereVal`, STRUCTURAL recursion on the source `List` — core Lean, NO Mathlib,
  NO fuel: the list shrinks by `List.tail`/`drop_first`). `permutation_of` threads `denote`/
  `refDenote` (a `Prop`), modelled via the COUNT-CHARACTERIZATION `∀ x, a.count x = b.count x`
  (core `List.count` — NOT Mathlib's `Multiset`; this IS multiset equality, and is what makes the
  multiset-vs-SET teeth `[1,1,2]`/`[1,2,2]` bite). Core Lean sufficed — NO Mathlib wall.

  DEFERRED — NOT embedded here, and DELIBERATELY NOT (no `sorry`-behind-a-variant;
  embedding-then-`sorry` is forbidden). The remaining sub-increment:
    - general USER-ADT match/is (beyond the built-in Option/Result) — see above.
  It is a real future inductive case, listed (not stubbed) so the deferral is honest.

      `encode_index`). The encoder rewrites to `xs@.subrange(lo, hi)`; the meaning is
      the corresponding contiguous SUB-sequence. SEQUENCE-sorted (`base` a sequence
      term, the range an integer-bounded `RangeArg`). -/
  | subrange (base : Expr) (range : RangeArg)
  /-- `xs.len()` / `s.len()` — the sequence length (#178; `Expr::MethodCall` `len`).
      For a slice it rewrites to `xs@.len()` (`encode_method_call`'s `len` arm); for a
      `String` to `s.spec_len()` (`encode_string_byteview`'s `len` arm). The meaning is
      the length of the sequence. INTEGER-sorted. -/
  | seqLen (base : Expr)
  /-- `s.byte_at(i)` — the i-th byte of a `String`'s byte sequence (#178; the #127
      byte-view DISPATCH; `Expr::MethodCall` `byte_at`). The encoder rewrites to
      `s.spec_byte_at(i)` (`encode_string_byteview`'s `byte_at` arm). The meaning is
      the i-th byte. INTEGER-sorted. `base` is a `String`-sequence term, `index` an
      integer term. THE #127 CLASS lives here: a wrong index / a wrong receiver-method
      is a DIFFERENT meaning (the negative lemma). -/
  | byteAt (base : Expr) (index : Expr)
  /-- A BOUNDED-QUANTIFIER combinator call (#179) — `Call(C, args)` for `C` in the 6
      frozen bounded combinators. Denotes its FROZEN `verus_l3` quantifier form
      (`combinators.rs`) with each argument threaded PER ITS REGISTRY ARG-KIND. The
      fields carry the per-kind args; each combinator populates exactly the fields its
      `CombinatorSig.arg_kinds` declares (`none` otherwise):
        - `seq`  : the primary slice (`ArgKind::Slice` → the `@`-view; SEQUENCE-sorted —
                   a `seqVar`/`strVar`/`subrange`).
        - `seq2` : the SECOND slice (only `disjoint`'s `b`; `ArgKind::Slice`).
        - `idx`  : the SCALAR index bound (only `forall_below`/`forall_from`'s `n`;
                   `ArgKind::Index` → a scalar `int`, NOT a slice `@`-view — THE #145 BUG
                   CLASS lives in this arg-kind's dispatch).
        - `pred` : the predicate closure (`ArgKind::Pred`; absent for `sorted`/`disjoint`).
      BOOLEAN/`Prop`-sorted (a combinator result is `bool`) — EXCEPT `countWhere` (#182), which is
      VALUE-sorted (`ResultKind::Usize`): it threads `intVal`/`refIntVal` (read at its integer COUNT),
      not `denote`/`refDenote`. The two #182 recursive/aggregate combinators populate the fields as:
        - `countWhere`    : `seq` = `s`, `pred` = `some p`     (`arg_kinds = [Slice, Pred]`).
        - `permutationOf` : `seq` = `a`, `seq2` = `some b`     (`arg_kinds = [Slice, Slice]`; like
          `disjoint` — two slices, no predicate). `Prop`-sorted (multiset equality). -/
  | comb (c : CombName) (seq : Expr) (seq2 : Option Expr) (idx : Option Expr)
         (pred : Option Pred)
  /-- A free `Option`/`Result`-valued variable (#180): the scrutinee of a contract-position
      `match`/`is` (a param or `result`). Its VALUE — `none`/`some v`/`ok v`/`err e` (the
      payload an `Int`, the C7 corpus shape) — lives in the env (`Denote.lean` `Env.optres`).
      Mirrors the `Expr::Path` scrutinee of an `Expr::Match`/`Expr::Is` whose type is the
      built-in `Option`/`Result`. OPTION/RESULT-sorted (observed only through `match_`/`is_`). -/
  | optResVar (name : String)
  /-- A contract-position `match scrut { <arms> }` (#180; `Expr::Match`) — the C7
      payload-in-contract projection `ens match result { Some(v) => P(v), None => Q }` (and the
      `Ok`/`Err` Result form). The arm SELECTED by the scrutinee's variant denotes its body with
      the payload BOUND (the binder ↦ the variant's payload value). `BOOLEAN`/`Prop`-sorted (each
      arm body is a flat `bool`). Mirrors `encode_match`: the scrutinee + arm bodies via the SAME
      recursion, the patterns via `encode_pattern`. MUTUAL with `MatchArm`. -/
  | match_ (scrut : Expr) (arms : List MatchArm)
  /-- A variant DISCRIMINANT test `scrut is variant` (#180; `Expr::Is`) — `result is Some` /
      `is None` / `is Ok` / `is Err`. `BOOLEAN`/`Prop`-sorted, true iff the scrutinee's value is
      that variant. Mirrors `ref_encode.rs`'s `Expr::Is` arm `({s} is {variant})`. -/
  | is_ (scrut : Expr) (variant : Variant)
  /-- A NAMED SPEC-FN CALL `name(args)` (#181; `Expr::Call` for a NON-combinator/NON-`old`
      callee — `ref_encode.rs::encode_call`'s case (3), which emits `name(<encoded args>)`,
      NOT inlining the body). The `name` resolves in the SHARED `Registry` (carried in the
      `Env`) to a `SpecFn` whose `body` (over the SAME fragment, MAY recurse via further
      `specCall`s) is denoted with the params bound to the denoted args. INTEGER- or
      BOOLEAN/`Prop`-sorted per the spec fn's return type. MUTUAL with `Expr` (the `args` are a
      `List Expr` of the same fragment). The well-founded denotation (the `dec` measure ⟹
      termination ⟹ the fixpoint) is the fuel-indexed `Denote.lean`/`RefEncode.lean` recursion,
      proved sound for ALL fuel (the source + encoder SHARE the fuel — not a fuel-cap dodge). -/
  | specCall (name : String) (args : List Expr)
  /-- A FLAT predicate closure `|x| <body>` (#179; `ArgKind::Pred`; `Expr::Closure` with
      one param over the frozen `Seq<u32>` element type `u32`). `bound` is the element
      var name the closure binds (`encode_pred_arg`'s `params[0]`); `body` is the
      predicate over that element, REUSING the comparison/logical/arithmetic `Expr`
      fragment (§4.2 "no anonymous nested quantifiers" — the body is FLAT, so the
      structural recursion terminates). `p(s[i])` denotes as `body` with `bound ↦` the
      i-th element. MUTUAL with `Expr` (the body IS an `Expr`). -/
inductive Pred where
  | mk (bound : String) (body : Expr)
  /-- A contract-position `match` ARM (#180) — mirrors `fluffy-syntax::ast::MatchArm` +
      `Pattern` RESTRICTED to the C7 built-in payload patterns `encode_pattern` admits:
      the matched `Variant` (`Some`/`None`/`Ok`/`Err` — the pattern HEAD) + an OPTIONAL payload
      binder name (the `Pattern::Enum`'s single field binding `Some(v)`/`Ok(v)`/`Err(e)`; `None`
      binds nothing) + the arm-body `Expr` (the flat arm predicate over the bound payload). A
      guard / wildcard / nested pattern is OUT of the C7 fragment (the corpus matches are
      exhaustive 2-arm `Some/None`/`Ok/Err`), so it is not modelled. MUTUAL with `Expr` (the
      body IS an `Expr`). -/
inductive MatchArm where

  /-- A range argument of a spec-context slice borrow (#178) — mirrors the

      `RangeTo(i)` (`&xs[..i]`), `Range(a, b)` (`&xs[a..b]`), `RangeFrom(a)`
      (`&xs[a..]`). A `Single(i)` is NOT here — a single-index borrow is the element
      form `Expr.idx` (`encode_index`'s `IndexArg::Single` arm), not a subrange. Each
      bound is an integer-valued `Expr` (cast `as int` by the encoder,
      `encode_index_value`). -/

/-- A NAMED SPEC FN (#181) — its signature/body as the registry stores it. Mirrors
    `fluffy-syntax::ast::SpecFnItem`'s `params`/`body` (the `name` is the registry key; the
    `ret` type only fixes whether the call is read at the integer or boolean meaning; the `dec`
    measure lives in the denotation's TERMINATION argument, not here):
      - `params` — the param NAMES, in order, bound to the denoted call args (`SpecFnItem.params`,
        their `Param.name`s).
      - `body`   — the body `Expr` over the SAME contract fragment (`SpecFnItem.body`); MAY contain
        further `specCall`s (recursion). The body is lowered ONCE as its own Verus `spec fn`
        (`ref_encode.rs` does NOT inline — `encode_call`'s case (3) emits a CALL), so the body's
        soundness is the EXISTING fragment applied to `body`, and the call-site soundness is the
        generic "args sound (IH) + SAME registry resolves the name". -/

/-- The SPEC-FN REGISTRY (#181): the name→`SpecFn` map, SHARED between `denote` and `refDenote`
    (the body's meaning is the same — it is lowered ONCE and sound by the fragment; the registry is
    the external ground truth, exactly like the frozen combinator registry `fluffy_spec::lookup`).
    Carried in the `Env` (`Denote.lean` `Env.specs`), so BOTH denotations resolve a `specCall`
    against the SAME registry — which is the load-bearing fact for the call-site soundness. A name
    absent from the registry denotes a canonical default (never observed by the soundness theorem,
    which only evaluates a `specCall` whose name the registry resolves). -/
