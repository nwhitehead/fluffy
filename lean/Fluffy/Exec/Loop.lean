  Fluffy/Exec/Loop.lean — the v1 `while`-LOOP extension of the exec-body
  state-transformer `S_B`: the fuel-indexed iteration semantics `loopDenote` + the
  PARTIAL-CORRECTNESS WHILE-RULE (`while_rule`) + its translation-validation meta-
  theorem `tv_meta_loop` (increment 2.2.2-ii, #163; epic #169). This is the LOOP
  brick of the proven spine — the universal Lean piece the per-run Z3 obligations
  (the Rust increment (i), `fluffy-tv`) compose with to certify a loop's after-state.

  Governing design: `.design/verified/loop-tv.md` REQ-3 (the Lean iteration semantics
  + the WHILE-RULE — the EXACT rule statement + premises) + REQ-4 (the trust
  accounting: PARTIAL correctness only — termination is the per-run Verus `decreases`
  residual, deliberately NOT a Lean premise). GROUNDED in the SHIPPED Rust increment
  (i) (`fluffy-tv/src/exec_stmt_encode.rs::loop_ref_obligations` + the three
  obligations `loop_{entry,preservation,exit}_obligation` in `obligation.rs`,
  commit `21b84c5f` — critic-clean): the Lean here is FAITHFUL to those exact shapes.

  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  THE MODELING DECISION — a SEPARATE `WhileLoop` AROUND the SHIPPED `blockThread`,
  NOT a new `Stmt`/`Block` case. (The critic diffs this against the Rust.)
  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  The Rust `loop_ref_obligations` treats a loop as a SEPARATE recognized form (the
  LAST statement before the tail, `recognize_v1_loop`), NOT a new `body_ref_state`
  statement arm: the loop body's SINGLE ITERATION is encoded by REUSING the SHIPPED
  straight-line `body_ref_state` (the loop body IS a straight-line `Block`), and the
  THREE loop obligations are built AROUND that reused step (entry / preservation /
  exit) — `body_ref_state` itself is UNCHANGED, with `Stmt::Loop` still `Unsupported`
  inside it. The FAITHFUL Lean mirror is therefore a SEPARATE `WhileLoop` + a
  `loopDenote` that ITERATES the SHIPPED `blockThread` (the Lean side of
  `body_ref_state`), with `Exec/Stmt.lean`'s `Stmt`/`Block`/`blockThread`/`State`
  UNCHANGED (NO new loop `Stmt` arm). Integrating `whileS` INTO the `Stmt` inductive
  would force reproving `body_ref_sound` over a changed type (a big perturbation the
  design does NOT require). The correspondence is EXACT:

    Rust (increment i)                        ↔  Lean (this module)
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    `recognize_v1_loop` (separate form)       ↔  `WhileLoop` (a separate structure)
    single iteration = `body_ref_state`        ↔  one step = `blockThread L.body`
    `loopDenote`-style genuine iteration       ↔  `loopDenote` (fuel-indexed iterate)
    ENTRY  `inv[cells:=entry]` ⊨ inv           ↔  `h_entry : I st₀`
    PRESERVATION `requires inv∧cond` one step   ↔  `h_pres` (one `blockThread` keeps I)
      `ensures inv[cells:=stepped]`               (under `I ∧ condHolds`)
    EXIT `requires inv ∧ !(cond)` ⊨ after       ↔  the rule's CONCLUSION
      after-loop = `inv ∧ ¬cond`                   `I stf ∧ condBool stf = some false`
    the `decreases` (Verus per-run residual)   ↔  the `h_run : loopDenote .. = some stf`
                                                  hypothesis (the loop EXITS — NOT proved)

  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  PARTIAL CORRECTNESS — the termination residual (REQ-4, R-HONEST-3).
  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  `while_rule` proves PARTIAL CORRECTNESS only: *after-loop holds IF the loop EXITS*
  (the `h_run : loopDenote cond body fuel st = some stf` hypothesis carries "exits at
  this fuel"). It deliberately does NOT prove termination. Termination is the Verus-
  checked `decreases` measure per run (`lower_loop` emits `decreases <dec>`, Verus
  discharges it; a non-decreasing measure → L0) — a NAMED per-run residual, exactly
  as Verus's own loop-termination check. `loopDenote`'s fuel-`0` `none` is NOT a
  fixpoint claim and NOT a vacuity dodge: `none` means "fuel exhausted, no result"
  (faithful to nontermination-as-obligation), and `while_rule` is ∀-fuel — it fires
  for EVERY fuel at which the loop actually exits. The fuel is the iteration COUNT, a
  genuine well-founded measure for the induction (NOT a cap on what the rule certifies).

  DEPENDENCIES: Lean 4 CORE ONLY. Reuses 2b's core-only `Stmt`/`Block`/`blockThread`/
  `State` (`Exec/Stmt.lean`) + 2a's `ExecExpr`/`execDenote`/`asBool` (`Exec`). The
  iteration is `Option`-monad composition; the rule is induction on `Nat` fuel
  discharged by `simp`/`omega`/`decide` — NO Mathlib, NO Lean-SMT, NO `sorry`/`admit`/
  `native_decide`. Mirrors the spine's core-only discipline.

/-! ## The `while` form (a SEPARATE recognized form — NOT a `Stmt` arm)

  A `WhileLoop` is the v1 frozen-subset loop: a condition `ExecExpr` (denoted by 2a's
  `execDenote`/`asBool`), a STRAIGHT-LINE `Block` body (the SHIPPED `blockThread`
  steps it once), and an invariant `I : State → Prop`.

  **The invariant modeling decision (JUSTIFIED).** The design (REQ-3) leaves the
  invariant modeling open ("an ExecExpr-denoted invariant OR a `State → Prop`
  predicate — decide the cleanest faithful modeling and justify"). We model `I` as a
  `State → Prop` predicate over the cells, NOT an `ExecExpr`, because:
    (1) The Rust obligations treat the invariant as a Verus PREDICATE over the cells
        (`encode_inv_clauses` emits a bool-valued Verus expression that the entry /
        preservation `requires`/`ensures` and the exit `requires` use as a PROP — Z3
        reasons about it as a logical predicate, not as a bounded exec VALUE). The
        WHILE-RULE's content is the LOGICAL relation entry→preservation→exit; a
        `State → Prop` is the faithful denotation of that Verus predicate (the same
        choice `S_C` makes for contract clauses — a `Prop`, not an exec value).
    (2) It keeps the rule GENERAL: `while_rule` holds for ANY invariant predicate
        (the `forall_*`-shaped corpus invariants included), exactly as the per-run
        Z3 check discharges whatever predicate the production emitted. An `ExecExpr`
        invariant would needlessly restrict to bool-decidable bounded forms.
    (3) The non-vacuity witnesses (`b_loop_iterates`, the negatives) instantiate `I`
        to a CONCRETE predicate (`lo ≤ n`) over the state's cells via `execDenote` /
        the `BVal.value`, so the modeling is not vacuous — a real invariant bites. -/

    the value `loopDenote`'s head test reads (`do let c ← asBool (← execDenote cond
    st.env)`), factored out so the rule's premises/conclusion name it directly. -/

/-! ## `loopDenote` — the GENUINE iteration semantics (fuel-indexed iteration of the

  The big-step meaning of the loop: iterate the SHIPPED single-step body transformer
  `blockThread body` until the condition is false, fuel-bounded on the iteration
  COUNT (the `Denote.lean` #181 fuel pattern — NOT a vacuity dodge; `while_rule` is
  ∀-fuel). `none` at fuel `0` = fuel exhausted (no result — NOT a fixpoint claim);
  `none` from `blockThread` = the body's obligation failed (overflow / out-of-range,
  PROPAGATED faithfully); `none` from `condBool` = a non-bool condition. FAITHFUL to
  the design's REQ-3 `loopDenote` (the exact pseudo-Lean there). -/

        loopDenote cond body fuel st'            -- consume one fuel, iterate
      else
        some st                                  -- exit: the after-loop state (`¬cond`)

/-! ## (T2-loop) — the PARTIAL-CORRECTNESS WHILE-RULE (the universal piece)

  The universally-proven Lean rule the per-run Z3 obligations compose with. The
  premises MATCH the Rust obligations' semantics (the critic diffs this):

    `h_entry`  ↔ ENTRY  (REQ-2.1): the invariant holds at the loop-entry state.
    `h_pres`   ↔ PRESERVATION (REQ-2.2): assuming `I ∧ cond` at the loop head, ONE
                 iteration of the SHIPPED `blockThread body` re-establishes `I` (the
                 havoc-cells + frame shape: Verus havocs the mutated cells, assumes
                 `I ∧ cond`, runs the body, must re-prove `I` — here the body step is
                 `blockThread body` over an ARBITRARY state satisfying `I ∧ cond`).
    conclusion ↔ EXIT (REQ-2.3): the after-loop state satisfies `I ∧ ¬cond`.

  PARTIAL correctness: the `h_run : loopDenote .. fuel st = some stf` hypothesis is
  the "loop EXITS at this fuel" premise (the Verus `decreases` residual, REQ-4).

  Proof: induction on `fuel`. `fuel = 0`: `loopDenote .. 0 st = none ≠ some stf`,
  vacuous. `fuel + 1`: case on `condBool cond st`:
    - `some false` (exit): `loopDenote` returns `some st`, so `stf = st`; the
      conclusion is `h_entry` + the false-condition fact directly.
    - `some true` (continue): the body steps to some `st'` (else `loopDenote = none ≠
      some stf`), `h_pres` re-establishes `I st'`, and the IH on `fuel` (with entry
      `I st'`) gives `I stf ∧ ¬cond stf`.
    - `none`: `loopDenote = none ≠ some stf`, vacuous. -/

/-! ## `tv_meta_loop` — the loop translation-validation meta-theorem (the capstone
    composition, sibling to `Faithfulness.lean`'s `tv_meta_body`)

  The capstone-pattern composition for the loop: the THREE per-run Z3 premises (the
  REQ-2 obligations, Z3-discharged) + `while_rule` ⟹ the after-loop state the TV
  certifies IS the true one. This is the loop sibling of `tv_meta_body`; the actual
  bundling into `FnTvWitness` lives in `Faithfulness.lean` (which imports this), but
  the COMPOSITION lemma is stated here against the genuine `loopDenote`. -/

/--
  **(T2-loop) — the loop TV meta-theorem.** For a v1 `WhileLoop` `L`, if the per-run
  Z3 obligations attested ENTRY (`h_entry : L.inv st`) and PRESERVATION (`h_pres`: one
  SHIPPED `blockThread L.body` step keeps `L.inv` under `L.inv ∧ cond`), then for EVERY
  fuel at which the loop EXITS (`h_run`, the Verus `decreases` residual), the TV-
  certified after-loop characterization `L.inv stf ∧ ¬cond stf` (the EXIT obligation's
  claim) is the TRUE meaning under the genuine iteration semantics `loopDenote`.

  This is `while_rule` packaged on the `WhileLoop` surface — the loop analogue of
  `tv_meta_body`'s `h_tv.trans (body_ref_sound ..)`: the three Z3-discharged premises
  compose with the kernel-proven `while_rule` to yield the universal after-state
  guarantee. The `∀ fuel/st/stf` is REAL; the premises are the genuine Z3 obligations
  (a wrong-invariant / wrong-after-state production does NOT satisfy them — see the
  negatives). RELATIVE to {Z3 (the three obligations), S = the intended meaning, the
  Lean kernel}; termination is the per-run Verus residual (PARTIAL correctness). -/

/-! ## NON-VACUITY — the L1 witness: a concrete faithful loop GENUINELY iterates

  Mirrors the Rust L1 fixture (`fluffy-tv/tests/loop_teeth.rs`):

      let mut lo: usize = 0;
      while lo < n  inv lo <= n  dec n - lo  { lo = lo + 1; }
      lo

  Here `n := 3`. The loop GENUINELY iterates (fuel consumed, the real per-iteration
  `lo ↦ lo+1` step run by the SHIPPED `blockThread`) to the real exit state `lo = 3`,
  and `while_rule` certifies `inv (lo ≤ 3) ∧ ¬(lo < 3)` — hence `lo = 3` — exactly the
  L1 after-loop fact `lo == n`. This proves `loopDenote` is REAL (not vacuous `none`)
  and `while_rule` FIRES on a genuine loop (not vacuously unusable). -/

/-- The L1 loop body: the single straight-line statement `lo = lo + 1` (the cell `lo`
    rebound — the SHIPPED `assign` form, AC-5 reuse), no tail (the iteration steps the
    state; the loop's tail value is the after-loop `lo`). -/

    `usize` TYPE-RANGE facts for the cells (`0 ≤ lo, n < 2^64`) — these are NOT an extra
    assumption: in Verus the cells are typed `usize`, so their in-range-ness is an
    IMPLICIT part of every loop invariant (the type system guarantees it). Modeling them
    explicitly here is faithful (the Lean `State.env.vars` is an untyped total map, so the
    type-range fact the Verus obligation gets for free must be stated). -/

  conclusion is exactly `inv ∧ ¬cond`, NOT a stronger over-claim (L3). -/

/-! ### L2 — a NON-PRESERVED invariant (the `lo + 2` shape): `h_pres` is load-bearing.

  Mirrors the Rust L2 (`loop_teeth.rs::l2_broken_preservation_caught`): a body that
  steps `lo` by 2 (the production infidelity for source `lo + 1`) does NOT preserve
  `inv lo ≤ n` — one iteration from a state with `lo = n - 1 < n` (so the loop-head
  guard holds, AND `inv` holds) lands at `lo = n + 1 > n`, BREAKING `inv`. We exhibit
  that concrete witness: the preservation premise `h_pres` is FALSE for this body, so
  the rule cannot be (mis)applied to certify it — `h_pres` genuinely gates. -/

    where `inv` is FALSE (`4 > 3`). -/

    `condBool l1Cond` is `some true` (`2 < 3`), so the PRESERVATION premise's antecedent
    is satisfied — yet the buggy `lo + 2` step lands at `lo = 4` where `l1Inv` is FALSE
    (`4 > 3`). So the preservation premise (instantiated for `l2Body`) is FALSE: there
    is NO valid `h_pres` for this buggy body. This PROVES `while_rule` genuinely
    CONSUMES `h_pres` — a vacuous rule (one that dropped `h_pres`) would WRONGLY certify

  after-loop characterization is `inv ∧ ¬cond` = `lo ≤ n ∧ ¬(lo < n)`, from which only
  `lo = n` follows. A production that OVER-CLAIMS `lo > n` is WRONG: the countermodel is
