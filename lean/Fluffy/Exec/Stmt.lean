  THE MODEL: a big-step STATE TRANSFORMER `S_B` over straight-line blocks.
  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  A STATE is the mutable bindings — an `ExecEnv` from 2a (var → `ExecVal`, slices →
  element sequences). `S_B` is a big-step evaluation `⟨B, σ⟩ ⇓ ⟨σ', v⟩` threading an
  initial state through a `Block` to a FINAL state + the tail value. The transformer
  is PARTIAL (`Option`): it propagates `none` whenever a sub-expression's OBLIGATION
  fails (2a's overflow / div-zero / shift-zero / out-of-range index) or a binding is
  missing / out of the frozen subset. The straight-line statement forms (faithful to
  `body_ref_state`, `exec-stmt-tv.md` REQ-1 IN set):

    - `let x = e`   — bind `x` to `execDenote e` in the current state, extend the env.
    - `assign x = e`— UPDATE an EXISTING scalar binding `x` to `execDenote e` (the
                      ORDER-SENSITIVE mutation: the rhs reads the state BEFORE this
                      assign; `s = s+1; s = s*2` ≠ `s = s*2; s = s+1`).
    - `ifElse c B₁ B₂` — branch on `execDenote c`: run `B₁` (then) or `B₂` (else) as a
                      sub-block state-transformer over the SAME state, recompose.
    - SEQUENCING (`Block.stmts` in order) — compose the per-statement transformers.
    - `ret e` / tail `e` — the body RESULT value, `execDenote e` in the FINAL state.

  FAITHFULNESS TO `body_ref_state` (the critic diffs this — read carefully).
  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  The Rust `body_ref_state` is a SYMBOLIC encoder: its env maps name → a closed-form
  VALUE `Expr` in the inputs, and `let`/`assign` SUBSTITUTE the rhs under the current
  env then rebind. That symbolic substitution is exactly a big-step state transformer
  whose state is the valuation (`exec_stmt_encode.rs` module doc: "Big-step evaluation
  threads an initial environment through the statement sequence to a FINAL
  environment; the body's value is the tail expression evaluated in that final
  environment"). `bodyDenote` (`S_B`) is that big-step transformer over VALUES;
  `bodyRefState` models the encoder's THREADING (its operational order: thread each
  stmt left-to-right into the state, then evaluate the tail in the final state — the
  exact loop in `encode_block_tail` + `thread_stmt`), independently of `bodyDenote`.
  `body_ref_sound` proves them equal construct-by-construct. The faithful match, arm
  by arm with `thread_stmt`:

    - `Stmt::Let { name, init }`  →  `Stmt.letS` : bind a FRESH name (the encoder
      REJECTS a re-shadow `let x=..; let x=..` — modelled: `bodyRefState` is `none`
      when `name` is already bound, matching `env.contains_key(name)` → `Err`).
    - `Stmt::Assign { Path[x], value }` → `Stmt.assign` : rebind an EXISTING bare
      scalar `x` (the encoder REJECTS a non-bare / non-scalar target `xs[i]=..` and an
      unbound target — modelled: `bodyRefState` is `none` when `x` is NOT already
      bound). NOTE: a NON-SCALAR mutation `xs[i] = e` is `Unsupported` in
      `body_ref_state` (the v1 frozen subset mutates only bare scalar cells — a
      sequence theory is v2), so it is NOT a `Stmt` form here (honest absence, not
      embed-then-`sorry`). The mutation `S_B` models is the SCALAR-cell rebind.
    - `Stmt::If { cond, then, else_ }` (statement position) → `Stmt.ifElse` : run each
      branch over the state, recompose. (The Rust composes the per-cell branch values
      into a Verus `if`-EXPRESSION; under any concrete state that `if`-expression
      EVALUATES to the taken branch's value — exactly `bodyDenote`'s branch.)
    - `Stmt::Expr(e)` → `Stmt.exprS` : a bare expr stmt with NO state effect — but it
      must be WELL-FORMED under the state (the encoder `substitute`s it to surface a
      value error). Modelled: `none` when `execDenote e` is `none`, else the state is
      UNCHANGED (faithful to `thread_stmt`'s `Stmt::Expr` arm: encode-and-discard).
    - the tail (`Block.tail`) → `Block.tail` : the body value `execDenote tail` in the
      final state; a tail `if`-EXPRESSION / a tuple tail are the `Expr`-level branch /
      multi-cell forms — modelled here at the value level via `execDenote` (the 2a
      `ExecExpr` already has neither an `if`-expr nor a tuple node: the BODY `ifElse`
      is the STATEMENT form, which is what `body_ref_state` threads; the tail value is
      a scalar exec expr, faithful to the scalar B1/B2 bodies). The Rust tuple-tail /
      if-EXPRESSION-tail are value-shape projections of the SAME final state; they are
      out of the 2a scalar `ExecExpr` and documented OUT here (not faked).

  LOOPS are EXPLICITLY OUT (increment 2c, #163, kernel-gated): a `Stmt::Loop`/`Break`/
  `Continue` is `Unsupported` in `body_ref_state` (the after-loop state needs the
  invariant / a fixpoint), so there is NO loop `Stmt` form here — straight-line blocks
  ONLY. Documented as 2c #163, NOT embedded-then-`sorry`. Likewise a mid-body early
  `return` (a multi-exit CPS form) is OUT of v1; the `ret` form here is the TAIL
  result only (the single-exit body value).

  DEPENDENCIES: Lean 4 CORE ONLY (reuses 2a's core-only `ExecExpr`/`execDenote`/
  `ExecVal`/`ExecEnv`; the state-threading is `Option`-monad composition; the proofs
  are `cases`/`simp`/`rfl`/`omega` — no Mathlib, no Lean-SMT). Mirrors 2a + the
  contract side's core-only discipline.

/-! ## The STATE + the `S_B` big-step state transformer (the source denotation)

  A STATE is an `ExecEnv` from 2a (var → `ExecVal`, slices → element sequences)
  TOGETHER WITH the set of names currently IN SCOPE (so `let` can reject a re-shadow
  and `assign` can reject an unbound target — exactly the `env.contains_key` guards in
  `thread_stmt`). 2a's `ExecEnv.vars` is a TOTAL function (every name has a default
  value), so the in-scope set is the extra structure the body subset needs (the
  encoder's env is a `BTreeMap` whose KEY SET is the in-scope set). -/

/-- The body STATE: 2a's `ExecEnv` (the valuation — scalar vars → bounded values,
    slices → element sequences) PLUS the set of in-scope binding names (the encoder's
    `BTreeMap` key set, needed for the re-shadow / unbound-target guards). A name not
    in `scope` is a free INPUT (a param) or unbound; a name in `scope` is a `let`-bound
    cell that `assign` may update. -/

  /-- The bounded valuation (reuses 2a's `ExecEnv`). -/

/-- Mark a name as in-scope (a `let`-bound cell). -/
def State.bind (st : State) (name : String) : State :=
  { st with scope := fun s => if s = name then true else st.scope s }

/-- Project a branch's resulting state `branch` back onto the PRE-`if` cell/scope set
    of `pre` (the encoder's `env.keys()` recomposition in `thread_stmt`'s `Stmt::If`
    arm). KEEPS the pre-`if` cells' (possibly branch-mutated) VALUES — a branch's
    `assign` to an in-scope cell persists, exactly as the encoder composes the
    branch-cell value into the post-`if` env — but DISCARDS any branch-local `let`
    (a cell NOT in the pre-`if` scope set, which lived only in the branch-env clone).
    The post-`if` scope set is the pre-`if` scope set; an in-scope cell takes the
    branch's value, a non-pre-`if` name keeps the pre-`if` valuation (the branch-local
    `let` does not leak). This mirrors `Stmt::If`'s `then_env = env.clone()` discipline
    (`fluffy-tv/src/exec_stmt_encode.rs`; `.design/verified/exec-stmt-tv.md`

  The body partiality is the 2a obligation (overflow / div-zero / out-of-range)
  threaded through the state — NOT a blanket `none`. A body whose RHS OVERFLOWS has no
  result; the SAME body with an in-range RHS HAS a result. This witnesses the
  partiality is the genuine obligation, not vacuous failure. -/

/-! ## NEGATIVE LEMMAS — the state-transformer infidelities BITE (mirror 2a / S_C)

  Three faithfulness bugs `body_ref_state` MUST NOT commit, each PROVEN to disagree
  with the faithful `bodyDenote` at a concrete state:
    (a) a WRONG-VAR assign (assigns `y` where the source assigns `x`);
    (b) a SEQUENCING bug (the two assigns composed in the WRONG ORDER);
    (c) a MUTATION not applied (the `assign` dropped, leaving the cell unchanged).
  Each builds a BUGGY encoder model and shows it ≠ `bodyDenote` at a witness — so a
  body encoder committing that bug would FAIL `body_ref_sound` exactly there. -/

/-- **(a) WRONG-VAR assign breaks soundness.** The source body `{ let mut s = x;
    s = s + 1; s }` (with `x := 5`) yields `s ↦ 6`. A buggy encoder that assigned the
    WRONG cell — modelled as a body that assigns to a DIFFERENT name `t` (so the read
    cell `s` is never updated) — yields `s ↦ 5` (the original). They DISAGREE
    (`some 5 ≠ some 6`). A wrong-var-target encoder does NOT satisfy `body_ref_sound`. -/
