  CRITIC PIN (cycle 5, #224) — proof-backends.md §4: the registry HARD GATE
  excludes the BODY's spec-calls, and the #214 ∀r result-binding makes that
  omission unsound. Kernel-checked against the shipped spine
  (`lean/Fluffy/Denote.lean`); `stabilizes`/`stabilizesProp` are copied
  VERBATIM from the doc's §4 definition block.

  Authority chain:
  - §4 "Registry population is an EXPORTER-SIDE HARD GATE": "The exporter
    computes `calledSpecFns(item)` (every spec-fn name reachable from
    `req ∪ ens`)" — the BODY is NOT in the gate's reachability set; and the
    exported `R_item` is "exactly calledSpecFns(item)" (the §4 display), so a
    spec-fn called ONLY by the body is omitted from `R_item` BY CONSTRUCTION,
    the gate `calledSpecFns ⊆ dom(R_item)` passes vacuously, and ZERO per-name
    `decide` lemmas are emitted for it (they too range over calledSpecFns).
  - §4 the #214 form: the theorem now binds the result THROUGH
    `∀ r, stabilizes body_expr env r → … ensStable(at r)` — so the BODY's
    denotation is newly load-bearing in the exported obligation, and the §4
    soundness paragraph itself says "each `specCall` reachable from
    `req`/`ens`/THE BODY has a FINITE unfolding depth" — assuming a body
    coverage the gate does not deliver. (§6.1 tier (a) likewise tests
    "no spec-fn appears in `req`/`ens`/body" — the author's own enumeration
    includes the body everywhere EXCEPT the gate.)
  - Spine ground truth: an UNRESOLVED `specCall` bottoms in `intVal` at EVERY
    fuel (`| none => 0` at fuel+1; catch-all `| _, _, _ => 0` at fuel 0) — so
    omission is not "fails to stabilize": it STABILIZES to the bottom, and the
    doc's own uniqueness-of-stabilization lever FORCES `r = 0`.

  The pin: item body `h(x)` with the true source registry `h(x) = 5`; `ens`
  mentions no spec-fn, so calledSpecFns = ∅ and R_item = the EMPTY registry —
  every §4 gate passes. Then:
  - `body_bottoms_at_every_fuel` / `omitted_body_stabilizes_to_bottom`:
    the body stabilizes to 0, not 5, under the omission;
  - `omission_forces_r_zero`: uniqueness forces r = 0;
  - `wrong_contract_certifies_under_body_omission`: the §4 exported obligation
    (the #214 ∀r form, req = true) DISCHARGES for the WRONG contract
    `ens: result == 0` — an unsound certification (the real item's result is 5);
  - `body_stabilizes_to_5_with_full_registry` / `full_registry_forces_r_five` /
    `wrong_contract_fails_with_full_registry`: with the body's spec-fn PRESENT
    the same obligation is REFUTED — so the discharge above is purely the
    gate's req∪ens-only scope. REGISTRY-TERMINATION (REQ-1.2) does not close
    this: with R_item = ∅ the class is not even ASSIGNED ("non-empty registry"),
    and dec-validity of PRESENT fns says nothing about ABSENT ones.

  The fix direction (the generator's, not mine): the gate's reachability set —
  and R_item's population and the per-name lemmas — must include the body's
  spec-calls (req ∪ ens ∪ body_expr) for the PURE-CONTRACT class.

  Tracking: crosslink #224. This file is the audit artifact; like
  PinIntBottom.lean / PinStabilization.lean it must keep compiling.
