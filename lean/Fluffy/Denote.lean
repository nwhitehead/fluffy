  Fluffy/Denote.lean — the SOURCE denotation `⟦·⟧_{S_C}` for the comparison +
  logical contract fragment (increment (a), #170) EXTENDED with the ARITHMETIC
  operators (#176), the CASTS (#177), the SPEC-CONTEXT REWRITES (#178 — slice→
  `@`/subrange, indexing, the `String` byte-view length/byte-at), and the 6
  BOUNDED-QUANTIFIER COMBINATORS (#179 / 1d-i — `forall_in`/`exists_in`/`sorted`/
  `forall_below`/`forall_from`/`disjoint`, each denoting its FROZEN `verus_l3`
  quantifier form from `fluffy-spec/src/combinators.rs`, with the predicate closure
  `p(s[i])` applied at the i-th element via `Env.bindInt`), and the MATCH-IN-ENS / `is`
  PAYLOAD-IN-CONTRACT forms (#180 / 1g — `match scrut { Some(v) => P(v), None => Q }` /
  `Ok`/`Err`, and `scrut is Variant`: the arm SELECTED by the scrutinee's `OptResVal` variant
  denotes its body with the payload BOUND via `Env.bindInt`; the `is`-test reads the variant).

  THE OPTION/RESULT ENVIRONMENT (#180). A `match`/`is` scrutinee (a param / `result` of a
  built-in `Option`/`Result` type) denotes an `OptResVal` (`none`/`some v`/`ok v`/`err e`, the
  payload an `Int` — the C7 corpus shape). The `Env` gains an `optres` map. The SOURCE meaning:
  `match scrut arms` = the body of the arm whose pattern variant matches `scrut`'s variant,
  denoted with the payload bound (`denoteArms`); `scrut is V` = `scrut`'s variant is `V`.

  THE SEQUENCE ENVIRONMENT (#178). A slice param `xs: &[u32]` and a `String`'s bytes
  denote a SEQUENCE (`List Int`), not a scalar. The `Env` is therefore extended to map
  free SEQUENCE names to `List Int` alongside the integer names. The SOURCE meaning
  (BEFORE the rewrite): `xs[i]` = the i-th element; `&xs[..i]` = the prefix
  `subrange(0,i)`; `s.byte_at(i)` = the i-th byte; `s.len()` = the length.

  THE SEQUENCE-ACCESS PARTIALITY CONVENTION (#178). An index `xs[i]` carries a source
  obligation `0 ≤ i < |xs|` (Verus rejects an out-of-bounds spec index — an L0/source
  precondition, exactly like the div-by-zero of #176). We model the access with the
  TOTAL `List.getD … 0` (out-of-range → `0`). This is sound for `S_C` for the SAME
  reason as the arithmetic partial point: the in-range obligation is a SOURCE-side
  precondition, and — load-bearing for T1 — BOTH `denote`/`intVal` (source) and
  `RefEncode.refDenote`/`refIntVal` (encoder) route the access through the SAME total
  `seqIdx` over the SAME `List` (the `@`-view is the identity on the value), so the
  soundness equation holds regardless of the out-of-range value. The same holds for
  `subrange` (`List.take`/`List.drop`, total) and `seqLen` (`List.length`, total).

  Governing design: `.design/verified/fluffy-semantics.md` Architecture §"S_C —
  the spec/contract sublanguage", REQ-1. This is `S_C` RESTRICTED to the fragment
  `Ast.lean` embeds: comparisons/logical denote the corresponding math relation
  (the STANDARD meaning), `Eq → =`, `Le → ≤`, `And → ∧`, `Not → ¬`; ARITHMETIC ops
  denote `int` arithmetic over the operand VALUES (`Add → +`, `Sub → -`, …; the
  doc's `⟦Binary(Add,a,b)⟧ = ⟦a⟧ + ⟦b⟧` rule, "arithmetic in subterms ... at the
  spec-context numeric domain"); CASTS denote the value coercion (the doc's
  `cast → nat/int` rule: "an integer cast denotes the value as an unbounded
  `nat`/`int` (no wrap — spec arithmetic is mathematical)").

  THE PARTIALITY CONVENTION (#176). `Div`/`Rem`/`Shl`/`Shr` are PARTIAL in the
  source (`ast.rs`: `BinOp::Rem` "requires a nonzero divisor"; the zero divisor /
  zero shift is rejected as a SOURCE PRECONDITION / L0 obligation, discharged
  OUTSIDE the clause). We model them with Lean's TOTAL `Int` operations
  (`Int./` is Euclidean-ish / T-division; `Int.%` its companion). This is sound
  for `S_C` because: (i) the divisor-≠0 precondition is a SOURCE-SIDE obligation,
  not part of the binop's contract MEANING; (ii) — load-bearing for T1 — `denote`
  and `refDenote` route the op through the SAME shared `arithDenote` function, so
  whatever total convention is chosen, BOTH sides agree (the soundness theorem is
  about the encoder's operator MAP being faithful, not about the partial-point
  value). The convention is stated here and held consistent across both denotations.

  THE CAST/`nat` CONVENTION (#177). `as nat` is the value injected into the
  naturals: a non-negative `int` maps to itself, a negative `int` maps to `0`
  (Lean `Int.toNat` clamps; in `S_C` an `as nat` always carries a `≥ 0` source
  frame, so the clamp point is never the intended value — the same shape as the
  zero-divisor convention). `as int`/`as u64`/`as u32`/`as usize` are
  value-preserving on the spec `int` domain (the bounded cast carries its
  no-overflow frame as a source obligation, exactly like div-by-zero), so at the
  CONTRACT level they denote the value unchanged. Again the convention is SHARED
  by `denote` and `refDenote` (`castDenote`), so T1 is insensitive to the clamp.

  THE NAMED SPEC-FN CALLS (#181, increment 1e — the WELL-FOUNDED RECURSIVE fragment). A
  `specCall name args` (`ast.rs` `Expr::Call` for a non-combinator/non-`old` callee — the
  `ref_encode.rs::encode_call` case (3)) denotes by RESOLVING the name in the SHARED `Registry`
  (`Env.specs`) to a `SpecFn { params, body }`, BINDING the params to the denoted args, and denoting
  the BODY. The body is an `Expr` of the SAME fragment and MAY contain further `specCall`s
  (recursion). §4.2 mandates a `dec` termination measure on every spec fn ⟹ the recursion terminates
  ⟹ the denotation is a well-founded fixpoint (the design `⟦Call(f,args)⟧ = ⟦body_of(f)⟧[params ↦
  ⟦args⟧]`, "well-defined because §4.2 mandates a `dec` measure").

  THE WELL-FOUNDED DENOTATION (the genuine difficulty). Rather than re-derive each registry's `dec`
  measure inside Lean, the denotation is FUEL-INDEXED: `denote (fuel : Nat) …`. A `specCall` consumes
  one unit of fuel (`fuel+1 → fuel` for the body); a structural subterm keeps the SAME fuel (it is
  smaller by `sizeOf`). The recursion is then well-founded on the lexicographic `(fuel, sizeOf e)`
  (Lean's `termination_by`/`decreasing_by`, CORE — no Mathlib). THIS IS NOT A FUEL-CAP VACUITY
  DODGE: (i) the soundness theorem `ref_sound` is proved for ALL `fuel` (∀-quantified); (ii) the
  SOURCE (`denote`) and the ENCODER (`refDenote`) use the SAME `fuel` and the SAME `Registry`, so at
  EVERY fuel — including the fuel-`0` bottom, where both bottom out to the IDENTICAL shared default
  `True`/`0` — the two sides AGREE (the call-site soundness is exactly "args agree by the IH + the
  SAME registry resolves the SAME body, denoted at the SAME fuel"). The `dec`-bounded source spec fn
  terminates, so for a real call there is always a fuel at which the fixpoint is reached; T1 holds
  uniformly across fuel, which is STRONGER than holding at one fuel.

  An `Env` maps each free name (a param / `result` / `old(x)`) to an `Int` — exactly
  the per-clause obligation binding `ref_encode.rs` describes — and carries the SHARED spec-fn
  `Registry` (#181). The non-spec-fn fragment is a TOTAL structural recursion (a clause is a pure
  predicate; no state, no loops); the spec-fn calls add the fuel-indexed well-founded layer.

      `  if s.len() == 0 { 0 } else { (if p(s[0]) {1} else {0}) + count_where(s.drop_first(), p) } }`

    This is STRUCTURAL recursion over the source `List Int` (core Lean — NO Mathlib, NO fuel: the
    list shrinks by `List.tail`, mirroring Verus's `s.drop_first()` / `decreases s.len()`). The
    per-element predicate is a `p : Int → Prop` (the closure body's denotation at the element); the
    `if p(s[0])` test uses `Classical` decidability (the soundness axiom set already admits
    `Classical`), so the `verus_l3` `(if p(s[0]) {1nat} else {0nat})` is modelled EXACTLY. SHARED by
    `intVal` (source) and `RefEncode.refIntVal` (encoder): BOTH pass the SAME structural-count
    function the SAME slice + predicate, so the soundness content is purely whether the slice + the
    per-element predicate agree (the `refSeqVal_eq_seqVal` + the recursive `ref_sound` IH on the
    flat closure body) — exactly mirroring how the bounded combinators reuse the frozen body.

    `verus_l3` `a.to_multiset() == b.to_multiset()` WITHOUT Mathlib's `Multiset`: two sequences are
    permutations iff EVERY value occurs the SAME number of times in both (core `List.count`). This IS
    multiset equality (two multisets are equal iff their per-element multiplicities coincide) — and
    is precisely what distinguishes it from SET equality (membership): `[1,1,2]` and `[1,2,2]` have
    the SAME set `{1,2}` but DIFFERENT multisets (`count 1` is `2` vs `1`), so `permEq` is FALSE on
    them while a set-based model would wrongly say TRUE (the multiset-vs-set teeth). SHARED by
