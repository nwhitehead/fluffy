"""
spec-discipline hook (greenfield, spec-driven variant of the vibe-fork
translate-discipline gate).

Fluffy has no upstream codebase to translate. The authority is the
design layer, not a foreign source tree. This hook enforces:

  "read goal.md, read the component's design doc, read any golden/
   conformance reference the route declares; THEN edit the toolchain."

as a deterministic per-edit gate.

Two invocations in .claude/settings.json:

  - PostToolUse on Read       -> records the Read in session state
  - PreToolUse  on Write|Edit -> gates writes to gated toolchain files

State is persisted at .crosslink/.spec-reads.json (per-worktree).

Required source classes for any gated edit:
  1. goal.md                         (always; the binding contract)
  2. .design/<area>/<doc>.md         (per route; must exist on disk + Read)
  3. route.reference[*]              (per route; ONLY if the route declares a
                                      non-empty `reference` list — then >=1
                                      reference path must be Read. These are
                                      conformance/ corpus entries or
                                      tests/golden/ files: the external truth.)

If a route is missing, the hook BLOCKS with instructions to add one.
If a design doc is missing, the hook BLOCKS with instructions to
dispatch acto-doc-author.
