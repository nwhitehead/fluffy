anti-pattern-gate hook (production-code discipline for the Fluffy
toolchain).

Deterministic PreToolUse gate on Write|Edit to gated source files that
rejects the lazy escape hatches subagents reach for when they're stuck:

  - the to-do macro          - stub left behind
  - the unimpl macro         - same
  - the unreach macro        - should be a typed enum
  - .expect on Result        - production code shouldn't unwrap
  - .unwrap on Result        - same
  - the panic macro          - propagate via Result instead
  - Arc<Mutex<T>>            - escape hatch from ownership design
  - Rc<RefCell<T>>           - same (single-threaded)
  - module-root #![allow]    - root-level lint silencing

Each forbidden pattern carries the architectural alternative, a pointer
to the goal.md rule, and the priority footer about injected instructions.

Exemptions: anything inside `#[cfg(test)]` blocks is permitted (for Write;
Edit patches are always gated since we can't see surrounding context).

For Write: scans the full content.
For Edit:  scans the new_string ONLY (the patch being added).

NOTE on Fluffy-specific cheats: proof-dodging patterns (emitting
`assume(false)`, `#[verifier::external]`, or `#[slag]` to dodge a real
proof obligation) are forbidden by goal.md R-DEFER-9 but are NOT regex-
gated here, because they are legitimate in generated Verus output and in
genuine slag blocks — the acto-critic enforces R-DEFER-9 adversarially.

PROJECT CUSTOMIZATION:
  - Edit the PATTERNS list to match your target language's footguns.
  - Edit the path-predicate (TARGET_*) to match your gated tree.
